<p><img src="images/d.png" class="floatLeft" width="150" height="170" alt="Capital I" /><br />ave done the thing his own
way," said Aunt Polly to the
Widow Cullom. "Kind o'
fetched it round fer a merry Chris'mus,
didn't he?"</p>

<p>This is the story which is reprinted here
from Mr. Westcott's famous book. It was
David Harum's nature to do things in his own
way, and the quaintness of his methods in
raising the Widow Cullom from the depths of
despair to the heights of happiness frame a
story which is read between laughter and
tears, and always with a quickening of affection
for the great-hearted benefactor. David
Harum's absolute originality, his unexpectedness,
the dryness of his humor, the shrewdness
of his insight, and the kindliness and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>

generosity beneath the surface, have made
him a permanent figure in literature. Moreover,
the individual quality of David Harum
is so distinctively American that he has been
recognized as the typical American, typical of
an older generation, perhaps, in mere externals,
but nevertheless an embodiment of characteristics
essentially national. While only Mr.
Westcott's complete book can fully illustrate
the personality of David Harum, yet it is
equally true that no other episode in the book
presents the tenderness and quaintness, and
the full quality of David Harum's character,
with the richness and pathos of the story
which tells how he paid the "int'rist" upon
the "cap'tal" invested by Billy P. Fortunately
this story lends itself readily to separate
publication, and it forms an American
"Christmas Carol" which stands by itself, an
American counterpart of the familiar tale of
Dickens, and imbued with a simplicity,
humor, and unstudied pathos peculiarly its
own.</p>

<p>The difference between the written and
the acted tale is illustrated in the use made
of the Christmas story in the play. In the
book David tells John Lenox the story of the
Widow Cullom and her dealings with 'Zeke

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a></span>

Swinney, and reveals the truth to her in his
office, and the dinner which follows at his
house is prolonged by his inimitable tales. In
the play action takes the place of description.
In the first act we see 'Zeke Swinney obtaining
blood-money from the widow, and the
latter makes the acquaintance of Mary Blake,
newly entered upon her career of independence
as Cordelia Prendergast. In the second
act we see the widow giving the second
mortgage to David, and thereby strengthening
Mary Blake's suspicions, and in the third
act David pictures his dreary youth and Billy
P.'s act of kindness, and brings the widow to
her own, the climax coming with the toast
which opens the dinner and closes the play.
It was a delicate and difficult task for even so
distinguished an actor as Mr. Crane to undertake
a part already hedged about by conflicting
theories; but his insight and his devotion
to the character have succeeded in actually
placing before us the David Harum created by
Mr. Westcott.</p>

<p>The illustrations of this book, reproduced
from stage photographs by the courtesy of
Mr. Charles Frohman, include the best pictures
of Mr. Crane in character, and also stage
views of scenes in the second and third acts,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a></span>

which show the development and culmination
of the Widow Cullom episode. The Christmas
Story is now published separately for
the first time in this volume, which unites a
permanent literary value with the peculiar
interest of Mr. Crane's interpretations of the
famous character.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After many discouragements, the author of
David Harum lived long enough to know that
his book had found appreciation and was to
be published, but he died before it appeared.</p>

<p>Edward Noyes Westcott, the son of Dr.
Amos Westcott, a prominent physician of
Syracuse, and at one time mayor of the city,
was born September 27, 1846. Nearly all his
life was passed in his native city of Syracuse.
His active career began early at a bank clerk's
desk, and he was afterward teller and cashier,
then head of the firm of Westcott &amp; Abbott,
bankers and brokers, and in his later years he
acted as the registrar and financial expert of
the Syracuse Water Commission. His artistic
temperament found expression only in music
until the last years of his life. He wrote
articles occasionally upon financial subjects,
but it was not until the approach of his last
illness that he began David Harum. No character

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a></span>

in this book is taken directly from life.
Stories which his father had told and his own
keen observations and lively imagination furnished
his material, but neither David Harum
nor any other character is a copy of any individual.
No trace of the author's illness
appears in the book. "I've had the fun of
writing it, anyway," he wrote shortly before
his death, "and no one will laugh over David
more than I have. I never could tell what
David was going to do next." This was
the spirit of the brave and gentle author,
who died March 31, 1898, unconscious of the
fame which was to follow him.</p>

<h1>The Christmas Story<br />
from David Harum<br /><br /><br /></h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p><img src="images/cap_i.png" class="floatLeft" width="150" height="170" alt="Capital I" /><br />t was the 23d of December,
and shortly after the closing
hour.  Peleg had departed
and our friend had just locked
the vault when David came
into the office and around behind the counter.</p>

<p>"Be you in any hurry?" he asked.</p>

<p>John said he was not, whereupon Mr.
Harum hitched himself up on to a high office
stool, with his heels on the spindle, and
leaned sideways upon the desk, while John
stood facing him with his left arm upon the
desk.</p>

<p>"John," said David, "do ye know the
Widdo' Cullom?"</p>

<p>"No," said John, "but I know who she
is&mdash;a tall, thin woman, who walks with a
slight stoop and limp. I noticed her and
asked her name because there was something
about her looks that attracted my attention&mdash;as

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>

though at some time she might have seen
better days."</p>

<p>"That's the party," said David. "She
has seen better days, but she's eat an' drunk
sorro' mostly fer goin' on thirty year, an'
darned little else a good share o' the time, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"She has that appearance certainly," said
John.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said David, "she's had a putty
tough time, the widdo' has, an' yet," he proceeded
after a momentary pause, "the' was a
time when the Culloms was some o' the kingpins
o' this hull region. They used to own
quarter o' the county, an' they lived in the
big house up on the hill where Doc Hays lives
now. That was considered to be the finest
place anywheres 'round here in them days.
I used to think the Capitol to Washington
must be somethin' like the Cullom house, an'
that Billy P. (folks used to call him Billy P.
'cause his father's name was William an' his
was William Parker), an' that Billy P. 'd jest
's like 's not be president. I've changed my
mind some on the subject of presidents since
I was a boy."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Harum turned on his stool, put
his right hand into his sack-coat pocket, extracted

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>

therefrom part of a paper of "Maple
Dew," and replenished his left cheek with an
ample wad of "fine-cut." John took advantage
of the break to head off what he had
reason to fear might turn into a lengthy
digression from the matter in hand by saying,
"I beg pardon, but how does it happen that
Mrs. Cullom is in such circumstances? Has
the family all died out?"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, "they're most on
'em dead, all on 'em, in fact, except the widdo's
son Charley, but as fur's the family's
concerned, it more 'n <i>died</i> out&mdash;it <i>gin</i> out!
'D ye ever hear of Jim Wheton's calf? Wa'al,
Jim brought three or four veals into town one
spring to sell. Dick Larrabee used to peddle
meat them days. Dick looked 'em over an'
says, 'Look here, Jim,' he says, 'I guess you
got a "deakin" in that lot,' he says. 'I
dunno what you mean,' says Jim. 'Yes, ye
do, goll darn ye!' says Dick, 'yes, ye do.
You didn't never kill that calf, an' you know
it. That calf died, that's what that calf done.
Come, now, own up,' he says. 'Wa'al,' says
Jim, 'I didn't <i>kill</i> it, an' it didn't <i>die</i> nuther&mdash;it
jes' kind o' <i>gin out</i>.'"</p>

<p>John joined in the laugh with which the
narrator rewarded his own effort, and David

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>

went on: "Yes, sir, they jes' petered out.
Old Billy, Billy P.'s father, inher'tid all the
prop'ty&mdash;never done a stroke of work in his
life. He had a collige education, went to
Europe, an' all that, an' before he was fifty
year old he hardly ever come near the old
place after he was growed up. The land was
all farmed out on shares, an' his farmers
mostly bamboozled him the hull time. He
got consid'able income, of course, but as
things went along and they found out how
slack he was they kept bitin' off bigger chunks
all the time, an' sometimes he didn't git even
the core. But all the time when he wanted
money&mdash;an' he wanted it putty often, I tell ye&mdash;the
easiest way was to stick on a morgige;
an' after a spell it got so 't he'd have to give
a morgige to pay the int'rist on the other
morgiges."</p>

<p>"But," said John, "was there nothing to
the estate but land?"</p>

<p class='center'><img src="images/005.jpg" width="372" height="550" alt="Sitting in Chair" /></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said David, "old Billy's father
left him some consid'able pers'nal, but after
that was gone he went into the morgige
bus'nis as I tell ye. He lived mostly up to
Syrchester and around, an' when he got married
he bought a place in Syrchester and lived
there till Billy P. was about twelve or thirteen

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>

year old, an' he was about fifty. By that
time he'd got 'bout to the end of his rope, an'
the' wa'n't nothin' for it but to come back
here to Homeville an' make the most o' what
the' was left&mdash;an' that's what he done, let

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>

alone that he didn't make the most on't to any
pertic'ler extent. Mis' Cullom, his wife, wa'n't
no help to him. She was a city woman an'
didn't take to the country no way, but when
she died it broke old Billy up wus 'n ever.
She peaked an' pined, an' died when Billy P.
was about fifteen or so. Wa'al, Billy P. an'
the old man wrastled along somehow, an' the
boy went to collige fer a year or so. How
they ever got along 's they did I dunno. The'
was a story that some far-off relation left old
Billy some money, an' I guess that an' what
they got off'm what farms was left carried
'em along till Billy P. was twenty-five or so,
an' then he up an' got married. That was the
crownin' stroke," remarked David. "She
was one o' the village girls&mdash;respectable folks,
more 'n ordinary good lookin' an' high steppin',
an' had had some schoolin'. But the
old man was prouder 'n a cock-turkey, an'
thought nobody wa'n't quite good enough fer
Billy P., an' all along kind o' reckoned that
he'd marry some money an' git a new start.
But when he got married&mdash;on the quiet, you
know, cause he knowed the old man would
kick&mdash;wa'al, that killed the trick, an' the old
man into the bargain. It took the gumption
all out of him, an' he didn't live a year.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>

Wa'al, sir, it was curious, but, 's I was told,
putty much the hull village sided with the old
man. The Culloms was kind o' kings in them
days, an' folks wa'n't so one-man's-good's-anotherish
as they be now. They thought
Billy P. done wrong, though they didn't have
nothin' to say 'gainst the girl neither&mdash;an'
she's very much respected, Mis' Cullom is, an'
as fur's I'm concerned, I've alwus guessed she
kept Billy P. goin' full as long 's any one
could. But 't wa'n't no use&mdash;that is to say,
the sure thing come to pass. He had a nom'nal
title to a good deal o' prop'ty, but the
equity in most on't if it had ben to be put up
wa'n't enough to pay fer the papers. You
see, the' ain't never ben no real cash value in
farm prop'ty in these parts. The' ain't ben
hardly a dozen changes in farm titles, 'cept by
inher'tance or foreclosure, in thirty years. So
Billy P. didn't make no effort. Int'rist's one
o' them things that keeps right on nights an'
Sundays. He jest had the deeds made out
an' handed 'em over when the time came to
settle. The' was some village lots though that
was clear, that fetched him in some money
from time to time until they was all gone but
one, an' that's the one Mis' Cullom lives on
now. It was consid'able more'n a lot&mdash;in fact,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>

a putty sizable place. She thought the sun
rose an' set where Billy P. was, but she took
a crotchit in her head, and wouldn't ever sign
no papers fer that, an' lucky fer him too.
The' was a house on to it, an' he had a roof
over his head anyway when he died six or
seven years after he married, an' left her with
a boy to raise. How she got along all them
years till Charley got big enough to help, I
swan! I don't know. She took in sewin' an'
washin', an' went out to cook an' nurse, an'
all that, but I reckon the' was now an' then
times when they didn't overload their stomechs
much, nor have to open the winders to
cool off. But she held on to that prop'ty of
her'n like a pup to a root. It was putty
well out when Billy P. died, but the village
has growed up to it. The's some good
lots could be cut out on't, an' it backs up
to the river where the current's enough to
make a mighty good power fer a 'lectric light.
I know some fellers that are talkin' of startin'
a plant here, an' it ain't out o' sight that
they'd pay a good price fer the river front, an'
enough land to build on. Fact on't is, it's got
to be a putty valu'ble piece o' prop'ty, more 'n
she cal'lates on, I reckon."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Harum paused, pinching his chin

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>

with thumb and index finger, and mumbling
his tobacco. John, who had listened with
more attention than interest&mdash;wondering the
while as to what the narrative was leading up
to&mdash;thought something might properly be
expected of him to show that he had followed
it, and said, "So Mrs. Cullom has kept this
last piece clear, has she?"</p>

<p>"No," said David, bringing down his right
hand upon the desk with emphasis, "that's
jes' what she hain't done, an' that's how I
come to tell ye somethin' of the story, an'
more on't 'n you've cared about hearin',
mebbe."</p>

<p>"Not at all," John protested. "I have
been very much interested."</p>

<p>"You have, have you?" said Mr. Harum.
"Wa'al, I got somethin' I want ye to do.
Day after to-morro' 's Chris'mus, an' I want
ye to drop Mis' Cullom a line, somethin' like
this, 'That Mr. Harum told ye to say that
that morgige he holds, havin' ben past due
fer some time, an' no int'rist havin' ben paid
fer, let me see, more'n a year, he wants to
close the matter up, an' he'll see her Chris'mus
mornin' at the bank at nine o'clock, he
havin' more time on that day; but that,
as fur as he can see, the bus'nis won't take

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>

very long'&mdash;somethin'
like that,
you understand?"</p>

<p><img src="images/010.jpg" class="floatLeft" width="400" height="500" alt="" /></p>

<p>"Very
well, sir,"
said John,
hoping that
his employer
would
not see in
his face the
disgust and
repugnance he
felt as he surmised
what a scheme was on foot, and recalled
what he had heard of Harum's hard
and unscrupulous ways, though he had to
admit that this, excepting perhaps the episode
of the counterfeit money, was the first revelation
to him personally. But this seemed
very bad indeed.</p>

<p>"All right," said David cheerfully, "I s'pose
it won't take you long to find out what's in
your stockin', an' if you hain't nothin' else to
do Chris'mus mornin' I'd like to have you
open the office an' stay 'round a spell till I
git through with Mis' Cullom. Mebbe the' 'll

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>

be some papers to fill out or witniss or somethin';
an' have that skeezicks of a boy make
up the fires so'st the place'll be warm."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said John, hoping that
the interview was at an end.</p>

<p>But the elder man sat for some minutes
apparently in a brown study, and occasionally
a smile of sardonic cunning wrinkled his face.
At last he said: "I've told ye so much that I
may as well tell ye how I come by that morgidge.
Twon't take but a minute, an' then
you can run an' play," he added with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"I trust I have not betrayed any impatience,"
said John, and instantly conscious of
his infelicitous expression, added hastily, "I
have really been very much interested."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," was the reply, "you hain't
<i>betrayed</i> none, but I know old fellers like me
gen'rally tell a thing twice over while they're
at it. Wa'al," he went on, "it was like this.
After Charley Cullom got to be some grown
he helped to keep the pot a-bilin', 'n they
got on some better. 'Bout seven year ago,
though, he up an' got married, an' then the
fat ketched fire. Finally he allowed that if he
had some money he'd go West 'n take up
some land, 'n git along like pussly 'n a flower

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>

gard'n. He ambitioned that if his mother 'd
raise a thousan' dollars on her place he'd be
sure to take care of the int'rist, an' prob'ly pay
off the princ'pal in almost no time. Wa'al,
she done it, an' off he went. She didn't come
to me fer the money, because&mdash;I dunno&mdash;at
any rate she didn't, but got it of 'Zeke
Swinney.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, it turned out jest 's any fool
might 've predilictid, fer after the first year,
when I reckon he paid it out of the thousan',
Charley never paid no int'rist. The second
year he was jes' gettin' goin', an' the next
year he lost a hoss jest 's he was cal'latin' to
pay, an' the next year the grasshoppers smote
him, 'n so on; an' the outcome was that at
the end of five years, when the morgige had
one year to run, Charley'd paid one year, an'
she'd paid one, an' she stood to owe three
years' int'rist. How old Swinney come to
hold off so was that she used to pay the cuss
ten dollars or so ev'ry six months 'n git no
credit fer it, an' no receipt an' no witniss, 'n
he knowed the prop'ty was improving all the
time. He may have had another reason, but
at any rate he let her run, an' got the shave
reg'lar. But at the time I'm tellin' you about
he'd begun to cut up, an' allowed that if she

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>

didn't settle up the int'rist he'd foreclose, an'
I got wind on't an' I run across her one day
an' got to talkin' with her, an' she gin me the
hull narration. 'How much do you owe the
old critter?' I says. 'A hunderd an' eighty
dollars,' she says, 'an' where I'm goin' to git
it,' she says, 'the Lord only knows.' 'An'
He won't tell ye, I reckon,' I says. Wa'al,
of course I'd known that old Swinney had a
morgidge because it was a matter of record,
an' I knowed him well enough to give a guess
what his game was goin' to be, an' more'n
that I'd had my eye on that piece an' parcel
an' I figured that he wa'n't any likelier a citizen
'n I was." ("Yes," said John to himself,
"where the carcase is the vultures are gathered
together.")</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' I says to her, after we'd had a
little more talk, 's'posen you come 'round to
my place to-morro' 'bout 'leven o'clock, an'
mebbe we c'n cipher this thing out. I don't
say positive that we kin,' I says, 'but mebbe,
mebbe.' So that afternoon I sent over to the
county seat an' got a description an' had a
second morgige drawed up fer two hundred
dollars, an' Mis' Cullom signed it mighty
quick. I had the morgige made one day
after date, 'cause, as I said to her, it was in

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>

the nature of a temp'rary loan, but she was so
tickled she'd have signed most anythin' at that
pertic'ler time. 'Now,' I says to her, 'you go
an' settle with old Step-an'-fetch-it, but don't
you say a word where you got the money,' I
says. 'Don't ye let on nothin'&mdash;stretch that
conscience o' your'n if nes'sary,' I says, 'an'
be pertic'ler if he asks you if Dave Harum give
ye the money you jes' say, "No, he didn't."
That won't be no lie,' I says, 'because I ain't
<i>givin</i>' it to ye,' I says. Wa'al, she done as I
told her. Of course Swinney suspicioned fust
off that I was mixed up in it, but she stood
him off so fair an' square that he didn't know
jes' what <i>to</i> think, but his claws was cut fer a
spell, anyway.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, things went on fer a while, till I
made up my mind that I ought to relieve
Swinney of some of his anxieties about
worldly bus'nis, an' I dropped in on him one
mornin' an' passed the time o' day, an' after
we'd eased up our minds on the subjects of
each other's health an' such like I says, 'You
hold a morgige on the Widder Cullom's
place, don't ye?' Of course he couldn't say
nothin' but 'yes.' 'Does she keep up the
int'rist all right?' I says. 'I don't want to be
pokin' my nose into your bus'nis,' I says,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>

'an' don't tell me nothin' you don't want to.'
Wa'al, he knowed Dave Harum was Dave
Harum, an' that he might 's well speak it out,
an' he says, 'Wa'al, she didn't pay nothin' fer
a good while, but last time she forked over
the hull amount. But I hain't no notion,' he
says, 'that she'll come to time agin.' 'An'
s'posin' she don't,' I says, 'you'll take the
prop'ty, won't ye?' 'Don't see no other
way,' he says, an' lookin' up quick, 'unless
you over-bid me,' he says. 'No,' I says, 'I
ain't buyin' no real estate jes' now, but the
thing I come in fer,' I says, 'leavin' out the
pleasure of havin' a talk with you, was to
say that I'd take that morgige off'm your
hands.'</p>

<p>"Wa'al, sir, he, he, he, he! Scat my&mdash;&mdash;!
At that he looked at me fer a minute with his
jaw on his neck, an' then he hunched himself,
'n drawed in his neck like a mud turtle.
'No,' he says, 'I ain't sufferin' fer the money,
an' I guess I'll keep the morgige. It's putty
near due now, but mebbe I'll let it run a spell.
I guess the secur'ty's good fer it.' 'Yes,' I
says, 'I reckon you'll let it run long enough
fer the widder to pay the taxes on't once more
anyhow; I guess the secur'ty's good enough
to take that resk; but how 'bout <i>my</i> secur'ty?'

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>

I says. 'What d'you mean?' he says. 'I
mean,' says I, 'that I've got a second morgige
on that prop'ty, an' I begin to tremble
fer my secur'ty. You've jes' told me,' I says,
'that you're goin' to foreclose an' I cal'late to
protect myself, an' I <i>don't</i> cal'late,' I says, 'to
have to go an' bid on that prop'ty, an' put in
a lot more money to save my investment,
unless I'm 'bleeged to&mdash;not <i>much!</i> an' you
can jes' sign that morgige over to me, an' the
sooner the quicker,' I says."</p>

<p>David brought his hand down on his thigh
with a vigorous slap, the fellow of the one
which, John could imagine, had emphasized
his demand upon Swinney. The story, to
which he had at first listened with polite
patience merely, he had found more interesting
as it went on, and, excusing himself, he
brought up a stool, and mounting it, said,
"And what did Swinney say to that?" Mr.
Harum emitted a gurgling chuckle, yawned
his quid out of his mouth, tossing it over his
shoulder in the general direction of the waste
basket, and bit off the end of a cigar which
he found by slapping his waistcoat pockets.
John got down and fetched him a match,
which he scratched in the vicinity of his hip
pocket, lighted his cigar (John declining to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>

join him on some plausible pretext, having
on a previous occasion accepted one of the
brand), and after rolling it around with his
lips and tongue to the effect that the lighted
end described sundry eccentric curves, located
it firmly with an upward angle in the left-hand
corner of his mouth, gave it a couple
of vigorous puffs, and replied to John's
question.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, 'Zeke Swinney was a perfesser
of religion some years ago, an' mebbe he is
now, but what he said to me on this pertic'ler
occasion was that he'd see me in hell fust, 'an
<i>then</i> he wouldn't.</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' I says, 'mebbe you won't,
mebbe you will, it's alwus a pleasure to meet
ye,' I says, 'but in that case this morgige
bus'nis 'll be a question fer our executors,' I
says, 'fer <i>you</i> don't never foreclose that morgige,
an' don't you fergit it,' I says.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you'd like to git holt o' that
prop'ty yourself. I see what you're up to,'
he says.</p>

<span class="left"><span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Harum</span>, Act II</span></p>

<p>"'Look a-here, 'Zeke Swinney,' I says,
'I've got an int'rist in that prop'ty, an' I propose
to p'tect it. You're goin' to sign that
morgige over to me, or I'll foreclose an' surrygate
ye,' I says, 'unless you allow to bid in

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>

the prop'ty, in which case we'll see whose
weasel-skin's the longest. But I guess it
won't come to that,' I says. 'You kin take
your choice,' I says. 'Whether I want to git
holt o' that prop'ty myself ain't neither here
nor there. Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't,
but anyways,' I says, '<i>you</i> don't git it, nor
wouldn't ever, for if I can't make you sign
over, I'll either do what I said or I'll back the
widder in a defence fer usury. Put that in
your pipe an' smoke it,' I says.</p>

<p>"'What do you mean?' he says, gittin'
half out his chair.</p>

<p>"'I mean this,' I says, 'that the fust six
months the widder couldn't pay she gin you
ten dollars to hold off, an' the next time
she gin you fifteen, an' that you've bled
her fer shaves to the tune of sixty odd dollars
in three years, an' then got your int'rist
in full.'</p>

<p>"That riz him clean out of his chair,"
said David. "'She can't prove it,' he says,
shakin' his fist in the air.</p>

<p class='center'><img src="images/021.jpg" width="356" height="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>"'Oh, ho! ho!' I says, tippin' my chair
back agin the wall. 'If Mis' Cullom was
to swear how an' where she paid you the
money, givin' chapter an' verse, and showin'
her own mem'randums even, an' I was to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>

couldn't <i>prove</i> it, how long do you think it
'ould take a Freeland County jury to find agin

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>

you look, not by a dum sight!' an' then how
I did laugh!</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, as he got down off
the stool and stretched himself, yawning, "I
guess I've yarned it enough fer one day.
Don't fergit to send Mis' Cullom that notice,
an' make it up an' up. I'm goin' to git the
thing off my mind this trip."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said John, "but let me
ask, did Swinney assign the mortgage without
any trouble?"</p>

<p>"O Lord! yes," was the reply. "The'
wa'n't nothin' else fer him to do. I had
another twist on him that I hain't mentioned.
But he put up a great show of doin' it to
obleege me. Wa'al, I thanked him an' so on,
an' when we'd got through I ast him if he
wouldn't step over to the 'Eagil' an' take
somethin', an' he looked kind o' shocked an'
said he never drinked nothin'. It was 'gin

chuckling to himself all the way out of the
office.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Considering John's relations with David
Harum, it was natural that he should wish to
think as well of him as possible, and he had
not (or thought he had not) allowed his mind
to be influenced by the disparaging remarks
and insinuations which had been made to
him, or in his presence, concerning his employer.
He had made up his mind to form
his opinion upon his own experience with the
man, and so far it had not only been pleasant
but favorable, and far from justifying the half-jeering,
half-malicious talk that had come
to his ears. It had been made manifest to
him, it was true, that David was capable of a
sharp bargain in certain lines, but it seemed
to him that it was more for the pleasure of
matching his wits against another's than for
any gain involved. Mr. Harum was an
experienced and expert horseman, who delighted
above all things in dealing in and trading
horses, and John soon discovered that, in

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>

that community at least, to get the best of a
"hoss-trade" by almost any means was considered
a venial sin, if a sin at all, and the
standards of ordinary business probity were
not expected to govern those transactions.</p>

<p>David had said to him once when he suspected
that John's ideas might have sustained
something of a shock, "A hoss-trade ain't like
anythin' else. A feller may be straighter 'n a
string in ev'rythin' else, an' never tell the
truth&mdash;that is, the hull truth&mdash;about a hoss.
I trade hosses with hoss-traders. They all
think they know as much as I do, an' I dunno
but what they do. They hain't learnt no
diff'rent anyway, an' they've had chances
enough. If a feller come to me that didn't
think he knowed anythin' about a hoss, an'
wanted to buy on the square, he'd git, fur's I
knew, square treatment. At any rate I'd tell
him all 't I knew. But when one o' them
smart Alecks comes along an' cal'lates to do
up old Dave, why he's got to take his
chances, that's all. An' mind ye," asserted
David, shaking his forefinger impressively, "it
ain't only them fellers. I've ben wuss stuck
two three time by church members in good
standin' than anybody I ever dealed with.
Take old Deakin Perkins. He's a terrible

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>

feller fer church bus'nes; c'n pray an' psalm-sing
to beat the Jews, an' in spiritual matters
c'n read his title clear the hull time, but when
it comes to hoss-tradin' you got to git up very
early in the mornin' or he'll skin the eye-teeth
out of ye. Yes, sir! Scat my&mdash;&mdash;! I believe
the old critter <i>makes</i> hosses! But the deakin,"
added David, "he, he, he, he! the
deakin hain't hardly spoke to me fer some
consid'able time, the deakin hain't. He,
he, he!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span></p>

<p class='center_pix' style="width: 600px"><img src="images/025.jpg" width="600" height="308" alt="" /><br />
<span class="left"><span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Harum</span>, Act III</span></p>

<p>"Another thing," he went on, "the' ain't
no gamble like a hoss. You may think you
know him through an' through, an' fust thing
you know he'll be cuttin' up a lot o' didos
right out o' nothin'. It stands to reason that
sometimes you let a hoss go all on the square&mdash;as
you know him&mdash;an' the feller that gits
him don't know how to hitch him or treat
him, an' he acts like a diff'rent hoss, an' the
feller allows you swindled him. You see,
hosses gits used to places an' ways to a certain
extent, an' when they're changed, why
they're apt to act diff'rent. Hosses don't
know but dreadful little, really. Talk about
hoss sense&mdash;wa'al, the' ain't no such thing."</p>

<p>Thus spoke David on the subject of his
favorite pursuit and pastime, and John thought

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>

then that he could understand and condone
some things he had seen and heard, at which
at first he was inclined to look askance. But
this matter of the Widow Cullom's was a
different thing, and as he realized that he was
expected to play a part, though a small one,
in it, his heart sank within him that he had so
far cast his fortunes upon the good will of a
man who could plan and carry out so heartless
and cruel an undertaking as that which had
been revealed to him that afternoon. He spent
the evening in his room trying to read, but the
widow's affairs persistently thrust themselves
upon his thoughts. All the unpleasant stories
he had heard of David came to his mind, and
he remembered with misgiving some things
which at the time had seemed regular and
right enough, but which took on a different
color in the light in which he found himself
recalling them. He debated with himself
whether he should not decline to send Mrs.
Cullom the notice as he had been instructed,
and left it an open question when he went to
bed.</p>

<p>He wakened somewhat earlier than usual
to find that the thermometer had gone up,
and the barometer down. The air was full of
a steady downpour, half snow, half rain,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>

about the most disheartening combination
which the worst climate in the world&mdash;that
of central New York&mdash;can furnish. He passed
rather a busy day in the office in an atmosphere
redolent of the unsavory odors raised
by the proximity of wet boots and garments
to the big cylinder stove outside the counter,
a compound of stale smells from kitchen and
stable.</p>

<p>After the bank closed he dispatched Peleg
Hopkins, the office boy, with the note for
Mrs. Cullom. He had abandoned his half-formed
intention to revolt, but had made the
note not only as little peremptory as was compatible
with a clear intimation of its purport
as he understood it, but had yielded to a
natural impulse in beginning it with an expression
of personal regret&mdash;a blunder which
cost him no little chagrin in the outcome.</p>

<p>Peleg Hopkins grumbled audibly when he
was requested to build the fires on Christmas
day, and expressed his opinion that "if there
warn't Bible agin workin' on Chris'mus, the'
'd ort ter be"; but when John opened the
door of the bank that morning he found the
temperature in comfortable contrast to the
outside air. The weather had changed again,
and a blinding snowstorm, accompanied by a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>

buffeting gale from the northwest, made it
almost impossible to see a path and to keep
it. In the central part of the town some tentative
efforts had been made to open walks,
but these were apparent only as slight and
tortuous depressions in the depths of snow.
In the outskirts the unfortunate pedestrian had
to wade to the knees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span></p>

<p class='center_pix' style="width: 320px"><img src="images/029.jpg" width="320" height="550" alt="" /><br />
<span class="left"><span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Harum</span>, Act III</span></p>

<p>As John went behind the counter his eye
was at once caught by a small parcel lying on
his desk, of white note paper, tied with a cotton
string, which he found to be addressed,
"Mr. John Lenox, Esq., Present," and as he
took it up it seemed heavy for its size.</p>

<p>Opening it, he found a tiny stocking, knit
of white wool, to which was pinned a piece
of paper with the legend, "A Merry Christmas
from Aunt Polly." Out of the stocking fell a
packet fastened with a rubber strap. Inside
were five ten-dollar gold pieces and a slip
of paper on which was written, "A Merry
Christmas from Your Friend David Harum."
For a moment John's face burned, and there
was a curious smarting of the eyelids as he
held the little stocking and its contents in
his hand. Surely the hand that had written
"Your Friend" on that scrap of paper could
not be the hand of an oppressor of widows

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>

and orphans. "This," said John to himself,
"is what he meant when he 'supposed it
wouldn't take me long to find out what was
in my stocking.'"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The door opened and a blast and whirl of
wind and snow rushed in, ushering the tall,
bent form of the Widow Cullom. The drive
of the wind was so strong that John vaulted
over the low cash counter to push the door
shut again. The poor woman was white
with snow from the front of her old worsted
hood to the bottom of her ragged skirt.</p>

<p>"You are Mrs. Cullom?" said John.
"Wait a moment till I brush off the snow,
and then come to the fire in the back room.
Mr. Harum will be in directly, I expect."</p>

<p>"Be I much late?" she asked. "I made 's
much haste 's I could. It don't appear to me
's if I ever see a blusteriner day, 'n I ain't as
strong as I used to be. Seemed as if I never
would git here."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said John, as he established
her before the glowing grate of the Franklin
stove in the back parlor, "not at all. Mr.
Harum has not come in himself yet. Shall
you mind if I excuse myself a moment while
you make yourself as comfortable as possible?" She

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>

did not apparently hear him. She
was trembling from head to foot with cold
and fatigue and nervous excitement. Her
dress was soaked to the knees, and as she sat
down and put up her feet to the fire John
saw a bit of a thin cotton stocking and her
deplorable shoes, almost in a state of pulp.
A snow-obliterated path led from the back
door of the office to David's house, and John
snatched his hat and started for it on a run.
As he stamped off some of the snow on the
veranda the door was opened for him by
Mrs. Bixbee. "Lord sakes!" she exclaimed.
"What on earth be you cavortin' 'round for
such a mornin' 's this without no overcoat,
an' on a dead run? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing serious," he answered, "but
I'm in a great hurry. Old Mrs. Cullom has
walked up from her house to the office, and
she is wet through and almost perished. I
thought you'd send her some dry shoes and
stockings, and an old shawl or blanket to
keep her wet skirt off her knees, and a drop
of whisky or something. She's all of a
tremble, and I'm afraid she will have a chill."</p>

<p>"Certain! certain!" said the kind creature,
and she bustled out of the room, returning in
a minute or two with an armful of comforts.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>

"There's a pair of bedroom slips lined with
lamb's wool, an' a pair of woolen stockin's,
an' a blanket shawl. This here petticut, 't
ain't what ye'd call bran' new, but it's warm
and comf'table, an' I don't believe she's got
much of anythin' on 'ceptin' her dress, an' I'll
git ye the whisky, but"&mdash;here she looked
deprecatingly at John&mdash;"it ain't gen'ally
known 't we keep the stuff in the house. I
don't know as it's right, but though David
don't hardly ever touch it he will have it in
the house."</p>

<p>"Oh," said John, laughing, "you may
trust my discretion, and we'll swear Mrs.
Cullom to secrecy."</p>

<p>"Wa'al, all right," said Mrs. Bixbee, joining
in the laugh as she brought the bottle;
"jest a minute till I make a passel of the
things to keep the snow out. There, now, I
guess you're fixed, an' you kin hurry back
'fore she ketches a chill."</p>

<p>"Thanks very much," said John as he
started away. "I have something to say to
you besides 'Merry Christmas,' but I must
wait till another time."</p>

<p>When John got back to the office David
had just preceded him.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, wa'al," he was saying, "but you

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>

be in a putty consid'able state. Hullo, John!
what you got there? Wa'al, you air the
stuff! Slips, blanket-shawl, petticut, stockin's&mdash;wa'al,
you an' Polly ben puttin' your
heads together, I guess. What's that?
Whisky! Wa'al, scat my&mdash;&mdash;! I didn't
s'pose wild hosses would have drawed it out
o' Polly to let on the' was any in the house,
much less to fetch it out. Jes' the thing! Oh,
yes ye are, Mis' Cullom&mdash;jest a mouthful with
water," taking the glass from John, "jest a
spoonful to git your blood a-goin', an' then
Mr. Lenox an' me 'll go into the front room
while you make yourself comf'table."</p>

<p>"Consarn it all!" exclaimed Mr. Harum as
they stood leaning against the teller's counter,
facing the street, "I didn't cal'late to have Mis'
Cullom hoof it up here the way she done.
When I see what kind of a day it was I went
out to the barn to have the cutter hitched an'
send for her, an' I found ev'rythin' topsy-turvy.
That dum'd uneasy sorril colt had got
cast in the stall, an' I ben fussin' with him
ever since. I clean forgot all 'bout Mis' Cullom
till jes' now."</p>

<p>"Is the colt much injured?" John asked.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, he won't trot a twenty gait in
some time, I reckon," replied David. "He's

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>

wrenched his shoulder some, an' mebbe
strained his inside. Don't seem to take no
int'rist in his feed, an' that's a bad sign. Consarn
a hoss, anyhow! If they're wuth anythin'
they're more bother 'n a teethin' baby.
Alwus some dum thing ailin' 'em, an' I took
consid'able stock in that colt too," he added
regretfully, "an' I could 'a' got putty near
what I was askin' fer him last week, an' putty
near what he was wuth, an' I've noticed that
most gen'ally alwus when I let a good offer
go like that, some cussed thing happens to
the hoss. It ain't a bad idee, in the hoss bus'nis
anyway, to be willin' to let the other
feller make a dollar once 'n a while."</p>

<p>After that aphorism they waited in silence
for a few minutes, and then David called out
over his shoulder, "How be you gettin'
along, Mis' Cullom?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'm fixed," she answered, and
David walked slowly back into the parlor,
leaving John in the front office. He was
annoyed to realize that in the bustle over Mrs.
Cullom and what followed, he had forgotten
to acknowledge the Christmas gift; but, hoping
that Mr. Harum had been equally oblivious,
promised himself to repair the omission
later on. He would have preferred to go out

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>

and leave the two to settle their affair without
witness or hearer, but his employer, who, as
he had found, usually had a reason for his
actions, had explicitly requested him to
remain, and he had no choice. He perched
himself upon one of the office stools and composed
himself to await the conclusion of the
affair.

<p>Mrs. Cullom was sitting at one corner of
the fire, and David drew a chair opposite to
her.</p>

<p>"Feelin' all right now? whisky hain't
made ye liable to no disorderly conduct, has
it?" he asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," was the reply, "the

Dave Harum, if you did send me this here

she added with a sigh of resignation.
"I ben fearin' fer a good while 't I couldn't
hold on t' that prop'ty, an' I don't know but
what you might's well git it as 'Zeke Swinney,
though I ben hopin' 'gainst hope that
Charley 'd be able to do morn 'n he has."</p>

<p>"Let's see the note," said David curtly.
"H'm, humph, 'regret to say that I have
been instructed by Mr. Harum'&mdash;wa'al,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>

h'm'm, cal'lated to clear his own skirts anyway&mdash;h'm'm&mdash;'must
be closed up without
further delay' (John's eye caught the little
white stocking which still lay on his desk)&mdash;'wa'al,
yes, that's about what I told Mr.
Lenox to say fur's the bus'nis part's concerned&mdash;I
might 'a' done my own regrettin' if I'd
wrote the note myself." (John said something
to himself.) "'T ain't the pleasantest
thing in the world fer ye, I allow, but then
you see, bus'nis is bus'nis."</p>

<p>John heard David clear his throat, and there
was a hiss in the open fire. Mrs. Cullom was
silent, and David resumed:</p>

<p>"You see, Mis' Cullom, it's like this. I
ben thinkin' of this matter fer a good while.
That place ain't ben no real good to ye sence
the first year you signed that morgidge. You
hain't scurcely more'n made ends meet, let
alone the int'rist, an' it's ben simply a question
o' time, an' who'd git the prop'ty in the long
run fer some years. I reckoned, same as you
did, that Charley 'd mebbe come to the front&mdash;but
he hain't done it, an' 't ain't likely he
ever will. Charley's a likely 'nough boy some
ways, but he hain't got much 'git there' in his
make-up, not more'n enough fer one anyhow,
I reckon. That's about the size on't, ain't it?"

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Cullom murmured a feeble admission
that she was "'fraid it was."</p>

<p class='center'><img src="images/041.jpg" width="372" height="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>"Wa'al," resumed Mr. Harum, "I see how
things was goin', an' I see that unless I played
euchre, 'Zeke Swinney 'd git that prop'ty, an'
whether I wanted it myself or not, I didn't

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>

cal'late he sh'd git it anyway. He put a spoke
in my wheel once, an' I hain't forgot it. But
that hain't neither here nor there. Wa'al,"
after a short pause, "you know I helped ye
pull the thing along on the chance, as ye may
say, that you an' your son 'd somehow make
a go on't."</p>

<p>"You ben very kind, so fur," said the
widow faintly.</p>

<p>"Don't ye say that, don't ye say that,"
protested David. "'T wa'n't no kindness.
It was jes' bus'nis. I wa'n't takin' no chances,
an' I s'pose I might let the thing run a spell
longer if I c'd see any use in't. But the' ain't,
an' so I ast ye to come up this mornin' so 't
we c'd settle the thing up without no fuss,
nor trouble, nor lawyer's fees, nor nothin'.
I've got the papers all drawed, an' John&mdash;Mr.
Lenox&mdash;here to take the acknowlidgments.
You hain't no objection to windin' the thing
up this mornin', have ye?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose I'll have to do whatever you
say," replied the poor woman in a tone of
hopeless discouragement, "an' I might as
well be killed to once, as to die by inch
pieces."</p>

<p>"All right then," said David cheerfully,
ignoring her lethal suggestion, "but before

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>

we git down to bus'nis an' signin' papers, an'
in order to set myself in as fair a light 's I can
in the matter, I want to tell ye a little story."</p>

<p>"I hain't no objection 's I know of," acquiesced
the widow graciously.</p>

<p>"All right," said David, "I won't preach
more 'n about up to the sixthly&mdash;How'd you
feel if I was to light up a cigar? I hain't much
of a hand at a yarn, an' if I git stuck, I c'n
puff a spell. Thank ye. Wa'al, Mis' Cullom,
you used to know somethin' about my folks.
I was raised on Buxton Hill. The' was nine
on us, an' I was the youngest o' the lot. My
father farmed a piece of about forty to fifty
acres, an' had a small shop where he done odd
times small jobs of tinkerin' fer the neighbors
when the' was anythin' to do. My mother
was his second, an' I was the only child of
that marriage. He married agin when I was
about two year old, an' how I ever got raised
's more 'n I c'n tell ye. My sister Polly was
'sponsible more 'n any one, I guess, an' the
only one o' the whole lot that ever gin me a
decent word. Small farmin' ain't cal'lated to
fetch out the best traits of human nature&mdash;an'
keep 'em out&mdash;an' it seems to me sometimes
that when the old man wa'n't cuffin' my ears
he was lickin' me with a rawhide or a strap. Fur 's

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>

that was concerned, all his boys used
to ketch it putty reg'lar till they got too big.
One on 'em up an' licked him one night, an'
lit out next day. I s'pose the old man's disposition
was sp'iled by what some feller said
farmin' was, 'workin' all day, an' doin' chores
all night,' an' larrupin' me an' all the rest on
us was about all the enjoyment he got. My
brothers an' sisters&mdash;'ceptin' of Polly&mdash;was
putty nigh as bad in respect of cuffs an' such
like; an' my stepmarm was, on the hull, the
wust of all. She hadn't no childern o' her
own, an' it appeared 's if I was jes' pizen to
her. 'T wa'n't so much slappin' an' cuffin'
with her as 't was tongue. She c'd say things
that 'd jes' raise a blister like pizen ivy. I
s'pose I <i>was</i> about as ord'nary, no-account-lookin',
red-headed, freckled little cuss as you
ever see, an' slinkin' in my manners. The air
of our home circle wa'n't cal'lated to raise
heroes in.</p>

<p>"I got three four years' schoolin', an' made
out to read an' write an' cipher up to long
division 'fore I got through, but after I got to
be six years old, school or no school, I had to
work reg'lar at anything I had strength fer,
an' more too. Chores before school an' after
school, an' a two-mile walk to git there. As

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>

fur 's clo'es was concerned, any old thing that
'd hang together was good enough fer me;
but by the time the older boys had outgrowed
their duds, an' they was passed on to me, the'
wa'n't much left on 'em. A pair of old cowhide
boots that leaked in more snow an' water
'n they kept out, an' a couple pairs of woolen
socks that was putty much all darns, was expected
to see me through the winter, an' I
went barefoot f'm the time the snow was off
the ground till it flew agin in the fall. The'
wa'n't but two seasons o' the year with me&mdash;them
of chilblains an' stun-bruises."</p>

<p>The speaker paused and stared for a moment
into the comfortable glow of the fire,
and then discovering to his apparent surprise
that his cigar had gone out, lighted it from a
coal picked out with the tongs.</p>

<p>"Farmin' 's a hard life," remarked Mrs.
Cullom with an air of being expected to make
some contribution to the conversation.</p>

<p>"An' yit, as it seems to me as I look back
on't," David resumed pensively, "the wust
on't was that nobody ever gin me a kind word,
'cept Polly. I s'pose I got kind o' used to
bein' cold an' tired; dressin' in a snowdrift
where it blowed into the attic, an' goin' out to
fodder cattle 'fore sun-up; pickin' up stun in

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>

the blazin' sun, an' doin' all the odd jobs my
father set me to, an' the older ones shirked
onto me. That was the reg'lar order o'
things; but I remember I never <i>did</i> git used to
never pleasin' nobody. Course I didn't expect
nothin' f'm my step-marm, an' the only
way I ever knowed I'd done my stent fur 's
father was concerned, was that he didn't say
nothin'. But sometimes the older one's 'd git
settin' 'round, talkin' an' laughin', havin' pop
corn an' apples, an' that, an' I'd kind o' sidle
up, wantin' to join 'em, an' some on 'em 'd
say, 'What <i>you</i> doin' here? time you was in
bed,' an' give me a shove or a cuff. Yes,
ma'am," looking up at Mrs. Cullom, "the
wust on't was that I was kind o' scairt the
hull time. Once in a while Polly 'd give me
a mossel o' comfort, but Polly wa'n't but little
older 'n me, an' bein' the youngest girl, was
chored most to death herself."</p>

<p>It had stopped snowing, and though the
wind still came in gusty blasts, whirling the
drift against the windows, a wintry gleam of
sunshine came in and touched the widow's
wrinkled face.</p>

<p>"It's amazin' how much trouble an' sorrer
the' is in the world, an' how soon it begins,"
she remarked, moving a little to avoid the sunlight.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>

"I hain't never ben able to reconcile
how many good things the' be, an' how little
most on us gits o' them. I hain't ben to
meetin' fer a long spell 'cause I hain't had no
fit clo'es, but I remember most of the preachin'
I've set under either dwelt on the wrath to
come, or else on the Lord's doin' all things
well, an' providin'. I hope I ain't no wickeder
'n than the gen'ral run, but it's putty hard
to hev faith in the Lord's providin' when you
hain't got nothin' in the house but corn meal,
an' none too much o' that."</p>

<p>"That's so, Mis' Cullom, that's so," affirmed
David. "I don't blame ye a mite.
'Doubts assail, an' oft prevail,' as the hymnbook
says, an' I reckon it's a sight easier to
have faith on meat an' potatoes 'n it is on corn
meal mush. Wa'al, as I was sayin'&mdash;I hope
I ain't tirin' ye with my goin's on?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Cullom, "I'm engaged to
hear ye, but nobody 'd suppose to see ye now
that ye was such a f'lorn little critter as you
make out."</p>

<p>"It's jest as I'm tellin' ye, an' more also,
as the Bible says," returned David, and then,
rather more impressively, as if he were leading
up to his conclusion, "it come along to a
time when I was 'twixt thirteen an' fourteen.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>

The' was a cirkis billed to show down here in
Homeville, an' ev'ry barn an' shed fer miles
around had pictures stuck on to 'em of el'phants,
an' rhinoceroses, an' ev'ry animul that
went into the ark; an' girls ridin' bareback an'
jumpin' through hoops, an' fellers ridin' bareback
an' turnin' summersets, an' doin' turnovers
on swings; an' clowns gettin' hoss-whipped,
an' ev'ry kind of a thing that could
be pictered out; an' how the' was to be a
grand percession at ten o'clock, 'ith golden
chariots, an' scripteral allegories, an' the hull
bus'nis; an' the gran' performance at two
o'clock; admission twenty-five cents, children
under twelve, at cetery, an' so forth. Wa'al,
I hadn't no more idee o' goin' to that cirkis 'n
I had o' flyin' to the moon, but the night
before the show somethin' waked me 'bout
twelve o'clock. I don't know how 't was.
I'd ben helpin' mend fence all day, an' gen'ally
I never knowed nothin' after my head
struck the bed till mornin'. But that night,
anyhow, somethin' waked me, an' I went an'
looked out the windo', an' there was the hull
thing goin' by the house. The' was more or
less moon, an' I see the el'phant, an' the big
wagins&mdash;the drivers kind o' noddin' over the
dashboards&mdash;an' the chariots with canvas covers&mdash;I

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>

don't know how many of 'em&mdash;an' the
cages of the tigers an' lions, an' all. Wa'al,
I got up the next mornin' at sun-up an' done
my chores; an' after breakfust I set off fer the
ten-acre lot where I was mendin' fence. The
ten-acre was the farthest off of any, Homeville
way, an' I had my dinner in a tin pail so't
I needn't lose no time goin' home at noon,
an', as luck would have it, the' wa'n't nobody
with me that mornin'. Wa'al, I got down
to the lot an' set to work; but somehow I
couldn't git that show out o' my head nohow.
As I said, I hadn't no more notion of goin' to
that cirkis 'n I had of kingdom come. I'd
never had two shillin' of my own in my hull
life. But the more I thought on't the uneasier
I got. Somethin' seemed pullin' an' haulin' at
me, an' fin'ly I gin in. I allowed I'd see that
percession anyway if it took a leg, an' mebbe
I c'd git back 'ithout nobody missin' me. 'T
any rate, I'd take the chances of a lickin' jest
once&mdash;fer that's what it meant&mdash;an' I up an'
put fer the village lickity-cut. I done them
four mile lively, I c'n tell ye, an' the stun-bruises
never hurt me once.</p>

<p>"When I got down to the village it
seemed to me as if the hull population of Freeland
County was there. I'd never seen so

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>

many folks together in my life, an' fer a spell
it seemed to me as if ev'rybody was a-lookin'
at me an' sayin', 'That's old Harum's boy
Dave, playin' hookey,' an' I sneaked 'round
dreadin' somebody 'd give me away; but I
fin'ly found that nobody wa'n't payin' any
attention to me&mdash;they was there to see the
show, an' one red-headed boy more or less
wa'n't no pertic'ler account. Wa'al, putty
soon the percession hove in sight, an' the' was
a reg'lar stampede among the boys, an' when
it got by, I run an' ketched up with it agin,
an' walked alongside the el'phant, tin pail an'
all, till they fetched up inside the tent. Then
I went off to one side&mdash;it must 'a' ben about
'leven or half-past, an' eat my dinner&mdash;I had a
devourin' appetite&mdash;an' thought I'd jes' walk
round a spell, an' then light out fer home.
But the' was so many things to see an' hear&mdash;all
the side-show pictures of Fat Women, an'
Livin' Skelitons; an' Wild Women of Madygasker,
an' Wild Men of Borneo; an' snakes
windin' round women's necks; hand-orgins;
fellers that played the 'cordion, an' mouth-pipes,
an' drum an' cymbals all to once, an'
such like&mdash;that I fergot all about the time an'
the ten-acre lot, an' the stun fence, an' fust I
knowed the folks was makin' fer the ticket

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>

wagin, an' the band begun to play inside the
tent. Be I taxin' your patience over the
limit?" said David, breaking off in his story
and addressing Mrs. Cullom more directly.</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," she replied; "I was
jes' thinkin' of a circus I went to once," she
added with an audible sigh.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, taking a last farewell
of the end of his cigar, which he threw into
the grate, "mebbe what's comin' 'ill int'rist
ye more 'n the rest on't has. I was standin'
gawpin' 'round, list'nin' to the band an'
watchin' the folks git their tickets, when all of
a suddin I felt a twitch at my hair&mdash;it had a
way of workin' out of the holes in my old
chip straw hat&mdash;an' somebody says to me,
'Wa'al, sonny, what you thinkin' of?' he
says. I looked up, an' who do you s'pose it
was? It was Billy P. Cullom! I knowed
who he was, fer I'd seen him before, but of
course he didn't know me. Yes, ma'am, it
was Billy P., an' wa'n't he rigged out to
kill!"</p>

<p>The speaker paused and looked into the
fire, smiling. The woman started forward
facing him, and clasping her hands, cried,
"My husband! What'd he have on?"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David slowly and reminiscently,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>

"near 's I c'n remember, he had on a
blue broadcloth claw-hammer coat with flat
gilt buttons, an' a double-breasted plaid velvet
vest, an' pearl-gray pants, strapped down over
his boots, which was of shiny leather, an' a
high pointed collar an' blue stock with a pin in
it (I remember wonderin' if it c'd be real gold),
an' a yeller-white plug beaver hat."</p>

<p>At the description of each article of attire
Mrs. Cullom nodded her head, with her eyes
fixed on David's face, and as he concluded she
broke out breathlessly, "Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
David, he wore them very same clo'es, an' he
took me to that very same show that very
same night!" There was in her face a look
almost of awe, as if a sight of her long-buried
past youth had been shown to her from a
coffin.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment or two, and it
was the widow who broke the silence. As
David had conjectured, she was interested at
last, and sat leaning forward with her hands
clasped in her lap.</p>

<p>"Well," she exclaimed, "ain't ye goin'
on? What did he say to ye?"</p>

<p>"Cert'nly, cert'nly," responded David.
"I'll tell ye near 's I c'n remember, an' I c'n
remember putty near. As I told ye. I felt a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>

twitch at my hair, an' he said, 'What be you
thinkin' about, sonny?' I looked up at him,
an' looked away quick. 'I dunno,' I says,
diggin' my big toe into the dust; an' then, I
dunno how I got the spunk to, for I was shyer
'n a rat, 'Guess I was thinkin' 'bout mendin'
that fence up in the ten-acre lot 's much 's
anythin',' I says.</p>

<p>"'Ain't you goin' to the cirkis?' he says.</p>

<p>"'I hain't got no money to go to cirkises,'
I says, rubbin' the dusty toes o' one foot over
t' other, 'nor nothin' else,' I says.</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' he says, 'why don't you crawl
under the canvas?'</p>

<p>"That kind o' riled me, shy 's I was. 'I
don't crawl under no canvases,' I says. 'If I
can't go in same 's other folks, I'll stay out,' I
says, lookin' square at him fer the fust time.
He wa'n't exac'ly smilin', but the' was a look
in his eyes that was the next thing to it."</p>

<p>"Lordy me!" sighed Mrs. Cullom, as if to
herself. "How well I can remember that
look; jest as if he was laughin' at ye, an'
wa'n't laughin' at ye, an' his arm around your
neck!"</p>

<p>David nodded in reminiscent sympathy,
and rubbed his bald poll with the back of his
hand.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span></p>

<p>"Wa'al," interjected the widow.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, resuming, "he says
to me, 'Would you like to go to the cirkis?'
an' with that it occurred to me that I did want
to go to that cirkis more'n anythin' I ever
wanted to before&mdash;nor since, it seems to me.
But I tell ye the truth, I was so far f'm expectin'
to go 't I really hadn't knowed I wanted
to. I looked at him, an' then down agin, an'
began tenderin' up a stun-bruise on one heel
agin the other instep, an' all I says was, bein'
so dum'd shy, 'I dunno,' I says. But I guess
he seen in my face what my feelin's was, fer
he kind o' laughed an' pulled out half-a-dollar
an' says: 'D' you think you could git a couple
o' tickits in that crowd? If you kin, I
think I'll go myself, but I don't want to git
my boots all dust,' he says. I allowed I c'd
try; an' I guess them bare feet o' mine tore up
the dust some gettin' over to the wagin.
Wa'al, I had another scare gettin' the tickits,
fer fear some one that knowed me 'd see me
with a half-a-dollar, an' think I must 'a' stole the
money. But I got 'em an' carried 'em back to
him, an' he took 'em an' put 'em in his vest
pocket, an' handed me a ten-cent piece, an'
says, 'Mebbe you'll want somethin' in the
way of refreshments fer yourself an' mebbe

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>

the el'phant,' he says, an' walked off toward
the tent; an' I stood stun still, lookin' after
him. He got off about a rod or so an'
stopped an' looked back. 'Ain't you comin'?'
he says.</p>

<p>"'Be I goin' with <i>you</i>?' I says.</p>

<p>"'Why not?' he says, ''nless you'd ruther
go alone,' an' he put his finger an' thumb
into his vest pocket. Wa'al, ma'am, I looked
at him a minute, with his shiny hat an' boots,
an' fine clo'es, an' gold pin, an' thought of my
ragged ole shirt, an' cotton pants, an' ole chip
hat with the brim most gone, an' my tin pail
an' all. 'I ain't fit to,' I says, ready to cry&mdash;an'&mdash;wa'al,
he jes' laughed, an' says, 'Nonsense,'
he says, 'come along. A man needn't
be ashamed of his workin' clo'es,' he says, an'
I'm dum'd if he didn't take holt of my hand,
an' in we went that way together."</p>

<p>"How like him that was!" said the widow
softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, I reckon it
was," said David, nodding.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," he went on after a little pause,
"I was ready to sink into the ground with
shyniss at fust, but that wore off some after a
little, an' we two seen the hull show, I <i>tell</i> ye.
We walked 'round the cages, an' we fed the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>

el'phant&mdash;that is, he bought the stuff an' I
fed him. I 'member&mdash;he, he, he!&mdash;'t he says,
'mind you git the right end,' he says, an'
then we got a couple o' seats, an' the doin's
begun."

<p>The widow was looking at David with
shining eyes and devouring his words. All
the years of trouble and sorrow and privation
were wiped out, and she was back in the days
of her girlhood. Ah, yes! how well she remembered
him as he looked that very day&mdash;so
handsome, so splendidly dressed, so debonair;
and how proud she had been to sit by his side
that night, observed and envied of all the village
girls.</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to go over the hull show,"
proceeded David, "well 's I remember it.
The' didn't nothin' git away from me that
afternoon, an' once I come near to stickin' a
piece o' gingerbread into my ear 'stid o' my
mouth. I had my ten-cent piece that Billy P.
give me, but he wouldn't let me buy nothin';
an' when the gingerbread man come along he
says, 'Air ye hungry, Dave? (I'd told him my
name), air ye hungry?' Wa'al, I was a growin'
boy, an' I was hungry putty much all the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>

time. He bought two big squares an' gin me
one, an' when I'd swallered it, he says, 'Guess
you better tackle this one too,' he says, 'I've
dined.' I didn't exac'ly know what 'dined'
meant, but&mdash;he, he, he, he!&mdash;I tackled it,"
and David smacked his lips in memory.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," he went on, "we done the hull
programmy&mdash;gingerbread, lemonade&mdash;<i>pink</i>
lemonade, an' he took some o' that&mdash;pop corn,
peanuts, pep'mint candy, cin'mun candy&mdash;scat
my&mdash;&mdash;! an' he payin' fer ev'rythin'&mdash;I
thought he was jes' made o' money! An' I
remember how we talked about all the doin's;
the ridin', an' jumpin', an' summersettin', an'
all&mdash;fer he'd got all the shyniss out of me for
the time&mdash;an' once I looked up at him, an' he
looked down at me with that curious look in
his eyes an' put his hand on my shoulder.
Wa'al, now, I tell ye, I had a queer, crinkly
feelin' go up an' down my back, an' I like to
up an' cried."</p>

<p>"Dave," said the widow, "I kin see you
two as if you was settin' there front of me.
He was alwus like that. Oh, my! Oh, my!
David," she added solemnly, while two tears
rolled slowly down her wrinkled face, "we
lived together, husban' an' wife, fer seven
year, an' he never give me a cross word."

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span></p>

<p>"I don't doubt it a mossel," said David
simply, leaning over and poking the fire,
which operation kept his face out of her sight
and was prolonged rather unduly. Finally he
straightened up and, blowing his nose as it
were a trumpet, said:</p>

<p>"Wa'al, the cirkis fin'ly come to an end,
an' the crowd hustled to git out 's if they was
afraid the tent 'd come down on 'em. I got
kind o' mixed up in 'em, an' somebody tried
to git my tin pail, or I thought he did, an' the
upshot was that I lost sight o' Billy P., an'
couldn't make out to ketch a glimpse of him
nowhere. An' <i>then</i> I kind o' come down to
earth, kerchug! It was five o'clock, an' I had
better 'n four mile to walk&mdash;mostly up hill&mdash;an'
if I knowed anything 'bout the old man,
an' I thought I <i>did</i>, I had the all-firedist lickin'
ahead of me 't I'd ever got, an' that was sayin'
a good deal. But, boy 's I was, I had grit
enough to allow 't was wuth it, an' off I
put."</p>

<p>"Did he lick ye much?" inquired Mrs.
Cullom anxiously.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," replied David, "he done his
best. He was layin' fer me when I struck the
front gate&mdash;I knowed it wa'n't no use to try
the back door, an' he took me by the ear&mdash;most

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>

pulled it off&mdash;an' marched me off to the
barn shed without a word. I never see him
so mad. Seemed like he couldn't speak fer a
while, but fin'ly he says, 'Where you ben all
day?'</p>

<p>"'Down t' the village,' I says.</p>

<p>"'What you ben up to down there?' he
says.</p>

<p>"'Went to the cirkis,' I says, thinkin' I
might 's well make a clean breast on't.</p>

<p>"'Where 'd you git the money?' he
says.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Cullom took me,' I says.</p>

<p>"'You lie,' he says. 'You stole the money
somewheres, an' I'll trounce it out of ye, if I
kill ye,' he says.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, twisting his shoulders
in recollection, "I won't harrer up your
feelin's. 'S I told you, he done his best. I
was willin' to quit long 'fore he was. Fact
was, he overdone it a little, an' he had to
throw water in my face 'fore he got through;
an' he done that as thorough as the other
thing. I was somethin' like a chickin jest out
o' the cistern. I crawled off to bed the best I
could, but I didn't lay on my back fer a good
spell, I c'n tell ye."</p>

<p>"You poor little critter," exclaimed Mrs.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>

Cullom sympathetically. "You poor little
critter!"</p>

<p>"'T was more'n wuth it, Mis' Cullom,"
said David emphatically. "I'd had the most
enjoy'ble day, I might say the only enjoy'ble
day, 't I'd ever had in my hull life, an' I hain't
never fergot it. I got over the lickin' in
course of time, but I've ben enjoyin' that cirkis
fer forty year. The' wa'n't but one thing
to hender, an' that's this, that I hain't never
ben able to remember&mdash;an' to this day I lay
awake nights tryin' to&mdash;that I said 'Thank
ye' to Billy P., an' I never seen him after that
day."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Mrs. Cullom.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," was the reply, "that day was
the turnin' point with me. The next night I
lit out with what duds I c'd git together, an'
as much grub 's I could pack in that tin pail;
an' the next time I see the old house on Buxton
Hill the' hadn't ben no Harums in it fer
years."</p>

<p>Here David rose from his chair, yawned
and stretched himself, and stood with his back
to the fire. The widow looked up anxiously
into his face. "Is that all?" she asked after
a while.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, it is an' it ain't. I've got through

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>

yarnin' about Dave Harum at any rate, an'
mebbe we'd better have a little confab on your
matters, seem' 't I've got you 'way up here
such a mornin' 's this. I gen'ally do bus'nis
fust an' talkin' afterward," he added, "but I
kind o' got to goin' an' kept on this time."</p>

<p>He put his hand into the breast pocket of
his coat and took out three papers, which he
shuffled in review as if to verify their identity,
and then held them in one hand, tapping them
softly upon the palm of the other, as if at a
loss how to begin. The widow sat with her
eyes fastened upon the papers, trembling with
nervous apprehension. Presently he broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"About this here morgige o' your'n," he
said. "I sent ye word that I wanted to close
the matter up, an' seem' 't you're here an'
come fer that purpose, I guess we'd better
make a job on't. The' ain't no time like the
present, as the sayin' is."</p>

<p>"I s'pose it'll hev to be as you say," said
the widow in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>"Mis' Cullom," said David solemnly, "<i>you</i>
know, an' I know, that I've got the repitation
of bein' a hard, graspin', schemin' man.
Mebbe I be. Mebbe I've ben hard done by all
my hull life, an' have had to be; an' mebbe,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>

now 't I've got ahead some, it's got to be second
nature, an' I can't seem to help it. 'Bus'nis
is bus'nis' ain't part of the golden rule, I
allow, but the way it gen'ally runs, fur 's I've
found out, is, 'Do unto the other feller the
way he'd like to do unto you, an' do it fust.'
But, if you want to keep this thing a-runnin'
as it's goin' on now fer a spell longer, say one
year, or two, or even three, you may, only I've
got somethin' to say to ye 'fore ye elect."</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said the poor woman, "I expect
it 'd only be pilin' up wrath agin the day o'
wrath. I can't pay the int'rist now without
starvin', an' I hain't got no one to bid in the
prop'ty fer me if it was to be sold."</p>

<p>"Mis' Cullom," said David, "I said I'd
got somethin' more to tell ye, an' if, when I
git through, you don't think I've treated you
right, includin' this mornin's confab, I hope
you'll fergive me. It's this, an' I'm the only
person livin' that 's knowin' to it, an' in fact I
may say that I'm the only person that ever
was really knowin' to it. It was before you
was married, an' I'm sure he never told ye,
fer I don't doubt he fergot all about it, but
your husband, Billy P. Cullom, that was, made
a small investment once on a time, yes, ma'am,
he did, an' in his kind of careless way it jes'

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>

slipped his mind. The amount of cap'tal he
put in wa'n't large, but the rate of int'rist was
uncommon high. Now, he never drawed no
dividends on't, an' they've ben 'cumulatin'
fer forty year, more or less, at compound
int'rist."</p>

<p>The widow started forward, as if to rise
from her seat. David put his hand out gently
and said, "Jest a minute, Mis' Cullom, jest a
minute, till I git through. Part o' that cap'tal,"
he resumed, "consistin' of a quarter an'
some odd cents, was invested in the cirkis
bus'nis, an' the rest on't&mdash;the cap'tal, an' all
the cash cap'tal that I started in bus'nis with&mdash;was
the ten cents your husband give me
that day, an' here," said David, striking the
papers in his left hand with the back of his
right, "<i>here</i> is the <i>dividends</i>! This here second
morgige, not bein' on record, may jest
as well go onto the fire&mdash;it's gettin' low&mdash;an'
here's a satisfaction piece which I'm goin' to
execute now, that'll clear the thousan' dollar
one. Come in here, John," he called out.</p>

<p>The widow stared at David for a moment
speechless, but as the significance of his words
dawned upon her, the blood flushed darkly in
her face. She sprang to her feet and, throwing
up her arms, cried out: "My Lord! My

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>

Lord! Dave! Dave Harum! Is it true?&mdash;tell
me it's true! You ain't foolin' me, air ye,
Dave? You wouldn't fool a poor old woman
that never done ye no harm, nor said a mean
word agin ye, would ye? Is it true? an' is
my place clear? an' I don't owe nobody anythin'&mdash;I
mean, no money? Tell it agin. Oh,
tell it agin! Oh, Dave! it's too good to be
true! Oh! Oh! Oh, <i>my</i>! an' here I be cryin'
like a great baby, an', an'"&mdash;fumbling in
her pocket&mdash;"I do believe I hain't got no
hank'chif.&mdash;Oh, thank ye," to John; "I'll do it
up an' send it back to-morrer.&mdash;Oh, what
made ye do it, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Set right down an' take it easy, Mis'
Cullom," said David soothingly, putting his
hands on her shoulders and gently pushing
her back into her chair. "Set right down an'
take it easy.&mdash;Yes," to John, "I acknowledge
that I signed that."</p>

<p>He turned to the widow, who sat wiping
her eyes with John's handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," he said, "it's as true as
anythin' kin be. I wouldn't no more fool ye,
ye know I wouldn't, don't ye? than I'd&mdash;jerk
a hoss," he asseverated. "Your place is clear
now, an' by this time to-morro' the' won't
be the scratch of a pen agin it. I'll send the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>

satisfaction over fer record fust thing in the
mornin'."</p>

<p>"But, Dave," protested the widow, "I
s'pose ye know what you're doin'&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he interposed, "I cal'late I do,
putty near. You ast me why I done it, an' I'll
tell ye if ye want to know. I'm payin' off an
old score, an' gettin' off cheap, too. That's
what I'm doin'! I thought I'd hinted up to it
putty plain, seem' 't I've talked till my jaws
ache; but I'll sum it up to ye if ye like."</p>

<p>He stood with his feet aggressively wide
apart, one hand in his trousers pocket, and
holding in the other the "morgige," which
he waved from time to time in emphasis.</p>

<p>"You c'n estimate, I reckon," he began,
"what kind of a bringin'-up I had, an' what
a poor, mis'able, God-fersaken, scairt-to-death
little forlorn critter I was; put upon, an'
snubbed, an' jawed at till I'd come to believe
myself&mdash;what was rubbed into me the hull
time&mdash;that I was the most all-'round no-account
animul that was ever made out o'
dust, an' wa'n't ever likely to be no diff'rent.
Lookin' back, it seems to me that&mdash;exceptin'
of Polly&mdash;I never had a kind word said to me,
nor a day's fun. Your husband, Billy P. Cullom,
was the fust man that ever treated me

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>

human up to that time. He give me the only
enjoy'ble time 't I'd ever had, an' I don't know
't anythin' 's ever equaled it since. He spent
money on me, an' he give me money to spend&mdash;that
had never had a cent to call my own&mdash;<i>an'</i>,
Mis' Cullom, he took me by the hand, an'
he talked to me, an' he gin me the fust notion
't I'd ever had that mebbe I wa'n't only the
scum o' the earth, as I'd ben teached to believe.
I told ye that that day was the turnin'
point of my life. Wa'al, it wa'n't the lickin' I
got, though that had somethin' to do with it,
but I'd never have had the spunk to run away
's I did if it hadn't ben for the heartenin' Billy
P. gin me, an' never knowed it, an' never
knowed it," he repeated mournfully. "I
alwus allowed to pay some o' that debt back
to him, but seein' 's I can't do that, Mis' Cullom,
I'm glad an' thankful to pay it to his
widdo'."</p>

<p>"Mebbe he knows, Dave," said Mrs. Cullom
softly.</p>

<p>"Mebbe he does," assented David in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a time, and then the
widow said: "David, I can't thank ye 's I
ought ter&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;but I'll pray
fer ye night an' mornin' 's long 's I got breath.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>

An', Dave," she added humbly, "I want to
take back what I said about the Lord's providin'."</p>

<p>She sat a moment, lost in her thoughts,
and then exclaimed, "Oh, it don't seem 's if I
c'd wait to write to Charley!"</p>

<p>"I've wrote to Charley," said David, "an'
told him to sell out there an' come home, an'
to draw on me fer any balance he needed to
move him. I've got somethin' in my eye
that'll be easier an' better payin' than fightin'
grasshoppers an' drought in Kansas."</p>

<p>"Dave Harum!" cried the widow, rising
to her feet, "you ought to 'a' ben a king!"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David with a grin, "I don't
know much about the kingin' bus'nis, but I
guess a cloth cap 'n' a hoss whip 's more 'n
my line than a crown an' scepter. An' now,"
he added, "'s we've got through 'th our bus'nis,
s'pose you step over to the house an'
see Polly. She's expectin' ye to dinner. Oh,
yes," replying to the look of deprecation in
her face as she viewed her shabby frock, "you
an' Polly c'n prink up some if you want to,
but we can't take 'No' fer an answer Chris'must
day, clo'es or no clo'es."</p>

<p>"I'd really like ter," said Mrs. Cullom.</p>

<p>"All right then," said David cheerfully.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>

"The path is swep' by this time, I guess, an'
I'll see ye later. Oh, by the way," he exclaimed,
"the's somethin' I fergot. I want
to make you a proposition, ruther an onusual
one, but seem' ev'rythin' is as 't is, perhaps
you'll consider it."</p>

<p>"Dave," declared the widow, "if I could,
an' you ast for it, I'd give ye anythin' on the
face o' this mortal globe!"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, nodding and smiling,
"I thought that mebbe, long 's you got
the int'rist of that investment we ben talkin'
about, you'd let me keep what's left of the
princ'pal. Would ye like to see it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Cullom looked at him with a puzzled
expression without replying.</p>

<p>David took from his pocket a large wallet,
secured by a strap, and, opening it, extracted
something enveloped in a much faded brown
paper. Unfolding this, he displayed upon his
broad fat palm an old silver dime black with
age.</p>

<p>"There's the cap'tal," he said.

<p>"Why, Mis' Cullom, I'm real glad to see
ye. Come right in," said Mrs. Bixbee as
she drew the widow into the "wing settin'
room," and proceeded to relieve her of her
wraps and her bundle. "Set right here
by the fire while I take these things of
your'n into the kitchen to dry 'em out. I'll
be right back"; and she bustled out of the
room. When she came back Mrs. Cullom
was sitting with her hands in her lap, and
there was in her eyes an expression of smiling
peace that was good to see.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bixbee drew up a chair, and seating
herself, said: "Wa'al, I don't know when
I've seen ye to git a chance to speak to ye, an'
I was real pleased when David said you was
goin' to be here to dinner. An' my! how
well you're lookin'&mdash;more like Cynthy Sweetland
than I've seen ye fer I don't know when;
an' yet," she added, looking curiously at her
guest, "you 'pear somehow as if you'd ben
cryin'."

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span></p>

<p>"You're real kind, I'm sure," responded
Mrs. Cullom, replying to the other's welcome
and remarks <i>seriatim</i>; "I guess, though,
I don't look much like Cynthy Sweetland, if
I do feel twenty years younger 'n I did a while
ago; an' I have ben cryin', I allow, but not fer
sorro', Polly Harum," she exclaimed, giving
the other her maiden name. "Your brother
Dave comes putty nigh to bein' an angel!"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," replied Mrs. Bixbee with a
twinkle, "I reckon Dave might hev to be
fixed up some afore he come out in that pertic'ler
shape, but," she added impressively,
"es fur as bein' a <i>man</i> goes, he's 'bout 's
good 's they make 'em. I know folks thinks
he's a hard bargainer, an' close-fisted, an'
some on 'em that ain't fit to lick up his tracks
says more'n that. He's got his own ways,
I'll allow, but down at bottom, an' all through,
I know the' ain't no better man livin'. No,
ma'am, the' ain't, an' what he's ben to me,
Cynthy Cullom, nobody knows but me&mdash;an'&mdash;an'&mdash;mebbe
the Lord&mdash;though I hev seen
the time," she said tentatively, "when it
seemed to me 't I knowed more about my
affairs 'n He did," and she looked doubtfully
at her companion, who had been following
her with affirmative and sympathetic nods,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>

and now drew her chair a little closer, and
said softly: "Yes, yes, I know. I ben putty
doubtful an' rebellious myself a good many
times, but seems now as if He had had me in
His mercy all the time." Here Aunt Polly's
sense of humor asserted itself. "What's Dave
ben up to now?" she asked.</p>

<p>And then the widow told her story, with
tears and smiles, and the keen enjoyment
which we all have in talking about ourselves
to a sympathetic listener like Aunt Polly,
whose interjections pointed and illuminated
the narrative. When it was finished she
leaned forward and kissed Mrs. Cullom on the
cheek.</p>

<p>"I can't tell ye how glad I be for ye," she
said; "but if I'd known that David held that
morgige, I could hev told ye ye needn't hev
worried yourself a mite. He wouldn't never
have taken your prop'ty, more'n he'd rob a
hen-roost. But he done the thing his own
way&mdash;kind o' fetched it round fer a Merry
Chris'mus, didn't he?"

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>David's house stood about a hundred feet
back from the street, facing the east. The
main body of the house was of two stories
(through which ran a deep bay in front), with
mansard roof. On the south were two stories
of the "wing," in which were the "settin'
room," Aunt Polly's room, and, above, David's
quarters. Ten minutes or so before one
o'clock John rang the bell at the front door.</p>

<p>"Sairy's busy," said Mrs. Bixbee apologetically
as she let him in, "an' so I come to
the door myself."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said John.
"Mr. Harum told me to come over a little
before one, but perhaps I ought to have
waited a few minutes longer."</p>

<p>"No, it's all right," she replied, "for
mebbe you'd like to wash an' fix up 'fore
dinner, so I'll jes' show ye where to," and
she led the way upstairs and into the "front
parlor bedroom."

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span></p>

<p>"There," she said, "make yourself comf'table,
an' dinner 'll be ready in about ten
minutes."</p>

<p>For a moment John mentally rubbed his
eyes. Then he turned and caught both of
Mrs. Bixbee's hands and looked at her,
speechless. When he found words he said:
"I don't know what to say, nor how to
thank you properly. I don't believe you
know how kind this is."</p>

<p>"Don't say nothin' about it," she protested,
but with a look of great satisfaction.
"I done it jes' t' relieve my mind, because
ever sence you fus' come I ben worryin' over
your bein' at that nasty tavern," and she
made a motion to go.</p>

<p>"You and your brother," said John earnestly,
still holding her hands, "have made me
a gladder and happier man this Christmas day
than I have been for a very long time."</p>

<p>"I'm glad on't," she said heartily, "an' I
hope you'll be comf'table an' contented here.
I must go now an' help Sairy dish up. Come
down to the settin' room when you're ready,"
and she gave his hands a little squeeze.</p>

<p>"Aunt Po&mdash;&mdash;, I beg pardon, Mrs. Bixbee,"
said John, moved by a sudden impulse,
"do you think you could find it in your heart

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>

to complete my happiness by giving me a
kiss? It's Christmas, you know," he added
smilingly.</p>

<p class='center_pix' style="width: 296px"><img src="images/079.jpg" width="296" height="550" alt="" /><br />
<span class="left"><span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Harum</span>, Act III</span></p>

<p>Aunt Polly colored to the roots of her
hair. "Wa'al," she said, with a little laugh,
"seein' 't I'm old enough to be your mother,
I guess 't won't hurt me none," and as she
went down the stairs she softly rubbed her
lips with the side of her forefinger.</p>

<p>John understood now why David had
looked out of the bank window so often that
morning. All his belongings were in Aunt
Polly's best bedroom, having been moved
over from the Eagle while he and David had
been in the office. A delightful room it was,
in immeasurable contrast to his squalid surroundings
at that hostelry. The spacious
bed, with its snowy counterpane and silk
patchwork "comf'table" folded on the foot,
the bright fire in the open stove, the big
bureau and glass, the soft carpet, the table for
writing and reading standing in the bay, his
books on the broad mantel, and his dressing
things laid out ready to his hand, not to mention
an ample supply of <i>dry</i> towels on the
rack.</p>

<p>The poor fellow's life during the weeks
which he had lived in Homeville had been

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>

utterly in contrast with any previous experience.
Nevertheless he had tried to make the
best of it, and to endure the monotony, the
dullness, the entire lack of companionship and
entertainment with what philosophy he could
muster. The hours spent in the office were
the best part of the day. He could manage to
find occupation for all of them, though a village
bank is not usually a scene of active
bustle. Many of the people who did business
there diverted him somewhat, and most
of them seemed never too much in a hurry to
stand around and talk the sort of thing that
interested them. After John had got acquainted
with his duties and the people he
came in contact with, David gave less personal
attention to the affairs of the bank; but
he was in and out frequently during the day,
and rarely failed to interest his cashier with
his observations and remarks.</p>

<p>But the long winter evenings had been
very bad. After supper, a meal which revolted
every sense, there had been as many
hours to be got through with as he found
wakeful, an empty stomach often adding to
the number of them, and the only resource for
passing the time had been reading, which had
often been well-nigh impossible for sheer

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>

physical discomfort. As has been remarked,
the winter climate of the middle portion of
New York State is as bad as can be imagined.
His light was a kerosene lamp of half-candle
power, and his appliance for warmth consisted
of a small wood stove, which (as David
would have expressed it) "took two men an'
a boy" to keep in action, and was either red
hot or exhausted.</p>

<p>As from the depths of a spacious lounging
chair he surveyed his new surroundings, and
contrasted them with those from which he
had been rescued out of pure kindness, his
heart was full, and it can hardly be imputed
to him as a weakness that for a moment his
eyes filled with tears of gratitude and happiness&mdash;no
less.</p>

<p>Indeed, there were four happy people at
David's table that Christmas day. Aunt Polly
had "smartened up" Mrs. Cullom with collar
and cuffs, and in various ways which the
mind of man comprehendeth not in detail; and
there had been some arranging of her hair as
well, which altogether had so transformed
and transfigured her that John thought that he
should hardly have known her for the forlorn
creature whom he had encountered in the
morning. And as he looked at the still fine

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>

eyes, large and brown, and shining for the first
time in many a year with a soft light of happiness,
he felt that he could understand how
it was that Billy P. had married the village
girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bixbee was grand in black silk and
lace collar fastened with a shell-cameo pin not
quite as large as a saucer, and John caught the
sparkle of a diamond on her plump left hand&mdash;David's
Christmas gift&mdash;with regard to
which she had spoken apologetically to Mrs.
Cullom:</p>

<p>"I told David that I was ever so much
obliged to him, but I didn't want a dimun'
more'n a cat wanted a flag, an' I thought it
was jes' throwin' away money. But he would
have it&mdash;said I c'd sell it an' keep out the poor-house
some day, mebbe."</p>

<p>David had not made much change in his
usual raiment, but he was shaved to the blood,
and his round red face shone with soap and
satisfaction. As he tucked his napkin into his
shirt collar, Sairy brought in the tureen of
oyster soup, and he remarked, as he took his
first spoonful of the stew, that he was "hungry
'nough t' eat a graven imidge," a condition
that John was able to sympathize with
after his two days of fasting on crackers and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>

such provisions as he could buy at Purse's.
It was, on the whole, he reflected, the most
enjoyable dinner that he ever ate. Never was
such a turkey; and to see it give way under
David's skillful knife&mdash;wings, drumsticks, second
joints, side bones, breast&mdash;was an elevating
and memorable experience. And such
potatoes, mashed in cream; such boiled onions,
turnips, Hubbard squash, succotash,
stewed tomatoes, celery, cranberries, "currant
jell!" Oh! and to "top off" with, a mince
pie to die for and a pudding (new to John, but
just you try it some time) of steamed Indian
meal and fruit, with a sauce of cream sweetened
with shaved maple sugar.</p>

<p>"What'll you have?" said David to Mrs.
Cullom, "dark meat? white meat?"</p>

<p>"Anything," she replied meekly, "I'm not
partic'ler. Most any part of a turkey 'll taste
good, I guess."</p>

<p>"All right," said David. "Don't care
means a little o' both. I alwus know what to
give Polly&mdash;piece o' the second jint an' the
last-thing-over-the-fence. Nice 'n rich fer
scraggly folks," he remarked. "How fer you,
John?&mdash;little o' both, eh?" and he heaped the
plate till our friend begged him to keep something
for himself.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span></p>

<p>"Little too much is jes' right," he asserted.</p>

<p>When David had filled the plates and
handed them along&mdash;Sairy was for bringing in
and taking out; they did their own helping to
vegetables and "passin'"&mdash;he hesitated a moment,
and then got out of his chair and started
in the direction of the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Bixbee
in surprise. "Where you goin'?"</p>

<p>"Woodshed!" said David.</p>

<p>"Woodshed!" she exclaimed, making as
if to rise and follow.</p>

<p>"You set still," said David. "Somethin'
I fergot."</p>

<p>"What on earth?" she exclaimed, with an
air of annoyance and bewilderment. "What
do you want in the woodshed? Can't you
set down an' let Sairy git it fer ye?"</p>

<p>"No," he asserted with a grin. "Sairy
might sqush it. It must be putty meller by
this time." And out he went.</p>

<p>"Manners!" ejaculated Mrs. Bixbee.
"You'll think (to John) we're reg'ler heathin'."</p>

<p>"I guess not," said John, smiling and much
amused.</p>

<p>Presently Sairy appeared with four tumblers

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>

which she distributed, and was followed by
David bearing a bottle. He seated himself and
began a struggle to unwire the same with an
ice-pick. Aunt Polly leaned forward with a
look of perplexed curiosity.</p>

<p>"What you got there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Vewve Clikot's universal an' suv'rin remedy,"
said David, reading the label and bringing
the corners of his eye and mouth almost
together in a wink to John, "fer toothache,
earache, burns, scalds, warts, dispepsy, fallin'
o' the hair, windgall, ringbone, spavin, disapp'inted
affections, an' pips in hens," and out
came the cork with a "<i>wop</i>," at which both
the ladies, even Mrs. Cullom, jumped and cried
out.</p>

<p>"David Harum," declared his sister with
conviction, "I believe thet that's a bottle of
champagne."</p>

<p>"If it ain't," said David, pouring into his
tumbler, "I ben swindled out o' four shillin',"
and he passed the bottle to John, who held it
up inquiringly, looking at Mrs. Bixbee.</p>

<p>"No, thank ye," she said with a little toss
of the head, "I'm a son o' temp'rence. I don't
believe," she remarked to Mrs. Cullom, "thet
that bottle ever cost <i>less</i> 'n a dollar." At
which remarks David apparently "swallered

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>

somethin' the wrong way," and for a moment
or two was unable to proceed with his dinner.
Aunt Polly looked at him suspiciously. It was
her experience that, in her intercourse with
her brother, he often laughed utterly without
reason&mdash;so far as she could see.</p>

<p>"I've always heard it was dreadful expensive,"
remarked Mrs. Cullom.</p>

<p>"Let me give you some," said John,
reaching toward her with the bottle. Mrs.
Cullom looked first at Mrs. Bixbee and then
at David.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "I never tasted
any."</p>

<p>"Take a little," said David, nodding approvingly.</p>

<p>"Just a swallow," said the widow, whose
curiosity had got the better of scruples. She
took a swallow of the wine.</p>

<p>"How do you like it," asked David.</p>

<p>"Well," she said as she wiped her eyes,
into which the gas had driven the tears, "I
guess I could get along if I couldn't have it
regular."</p>

<p>"Don't taste good?" suggested David with
a grin.</p>

<p>"Well," she replied, "I never did care any
great for cider, and this tastes to me about as

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>

if I was drinkin' cider an' snuffin' horseredish
at one and the same time."</p>

<p>"How's that, John?" said David, laughing.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's an acquired taste," said
John, returning the laugh and taking a mouthful
of the wine with infinite relish. "I don't
think I ever enjoyed a glass of wine so much,
or," turning to Aunt Polly, "ever enjoyed a
dinner so much," which statement completely
mollified her feelings, which had been the least
bit in the world "set edgeways."</p>

<p>"Mebbe your app'tite's got somethin' to
do with it," said David, shoveling a knife-load
of good things into his mouth. "Polly, this
young man's ben livin' on crackers an' salt
herrin' fer a week."</p>

<p>"My land!" cried Mrs. Bixbee with an
expression of horror. "Is that reelly so?
'T ain't now, reelly?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that," John answered,
smiling; "but Mrs. Elright has been ill for a
couple of days and&mdash;well, I have been foraging
around Purse's store a little."</p>

<p>"Wa'al, of all the mean shames!" exclaimed
Aunt Polly indignantly. "David
Harum, you'd ought to be ridic'lous t' allow
such a thing."</p>

<p class='center_pix pix_title'><img src="images/089.jpg" width="600" height="304" alt="" /><br />
<span class="left"><span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Harum</span>, Act III</span></p>

<p>"Wa'al, I never!" said David, holding his

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>

knife and fork straight up in either fist as they
rested on the table, and staring at his sister.
"I believe if the meetin'-house roof was to
blow off you'd lay it on to me somehow. I
hain't ben runnin' the Eagle tavern fer quite a
consid'able while. You got the wrong pig by
the ear as usual. Jes' you pitch into him,"
pointing with his fork to John. "It's his
funeral, if anybody's."</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said Aunt Polly, addressing John
in a tone of injury, "I do think you might
have let somebody know; I think you'd ortter
've known&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Bixbee," he interrupted, "I
did know how kind you are and would have
been, and if matters had gone on so much
longer I should have appealed to you, I should
have indeed; but really," he added, smiling
at her, "a dinner like this is worth fasting a
week for."</p>

<p>"Wa'al," she said, mollified again, "you
won't git no more herrin' 'nless you ask for
'em."</p>

<p>"That is just what your brother said this
morning," replied John, looking at David with
a laugh.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The meal proceeded in silence for a few
minutes. Mrs. Cullom had said but little, but
John noticed that her diction was more conventional
than in her talk with David and
himself in the morning, and that her manner
at the table was distinctly refined, although she
ate with apparent appetite, not to say hunger.
Presently she said, with an air of making conversation,
"I suppose you've always lived in
the city, Mr. Lenox?"</p>

<p>"It has always been my home," he replied,
"but I have been away a good
deal."</p>

<p>"I suppose folks in the city go to theaters
a good deal," she remarked.</p>

<p>"They have a great many opportunities,"
said John, wondering what she was leading
up to. But he was not to discover, for David
broke in with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Ask Polly, Mis' Cullom," he said. "She
c'n tell ye all about the theater, Polly kin."

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>

Mrs. Cullom looked from David to Mrs. Bixbee,
whose face was suffused.</p>

<p>"Tell her," said David, with a grin.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd shet up," she exclaimed.
"I sha'n't do nothin' of the sort."</p>

<p>"Ne' mind," said David cheerfully. "<i>I'll</i>
tell ye, Mis' Cullom."</p>

<p>"Dave Harum!" expostulated Mrs. Bixbee,
but he proceeded without heed of her
protest.</p>

<p>"Polly an' I," he said, "went down to
New York one spring some years ago. Her
nerves was some wore out 'long of diff'rences
with Sairy about clearin' up the woodshed,
an' bread risin's, an' not bein' able to suit herself
up to Purse's in the qual'ty of silk velvit
she wanted fer a Sunday-go-to-meetin' gown,
an' I thought a spell off 'd do her good.
Wa'al, the day after we got there I says to
her while we was havin' breakfust&mdash;it was
picked-up el'phant on toast, near 's I c'n
remember, wa'n't it, Polly?"</p>

<p>"That's as near the truth as most o' the
rest on't so fur," said Polly with a sniff.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I says to her," he proceeded, untouched
by her scorn, "'How'd you like to
go t' the theater? You hain't never ben,' I
says, 'an' now you're down here you may

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>

jes' as well see somethin' while you got a
chanst,' I says. Up to that <i>time</i>," he remarked,
as it were in passing, "she'd ben
somewhat pre<i>juced</i> 'ginst theaters, an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," Mrs. Bixbee broke in, "I guess
what we see that night was cal'lated&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You hold on," he interposed. "I'm
tellin' this story. You had a chanst to an'
wouldn't. Anyway," he resumed, "she
allowed she'd try it once, an' we agreed we'd
go somewheres that night. But somethin'
happened to put it out o' my mind, an' I
didn't think on't agin till I got back to the
hotel fer supper. So I went to the feller at the
news-stand an' says, 'Got any show-tickits
fer to-night?'</p>

<p>"'Theater?' he says.</p>

<p>"'I reckon so,' I says.</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' he says, 'I hain't got nothin'
now but two seats fer "Clyanthy."'</p>

<p>"'Is it a good show?' I says&mdash;'moral, an'
so on? I'm goin' to take my sister, an' she's
a little pertic'ler about some things,' I says.
He kind o' grinned, the feller did. 'I've took
my wife twice, an' she's putty pertic'ler herself,'
he says, laughin'."</p>

<p>"She must 'a' ben," remarked Mrs. Bixbee
with a sniff that spoke volumes of her opinion

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>

of "the feller's wife." David emitted a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," he continued, "I took the tickits
on the feller's recommend, an' the fact of his
wife's bein' so pertic'ler, an' after supper we
went. It was a mighty handsome place
inside, gilded an' carved all over like the outside
of a cirkis wagin, an' when we went in
the orchestry was playin' an' the people was
comin' in, an' after we'd set a few minutes I
says to Polly, 'What do you think on't?' I
says.</p>

<p>"'I don't see anythin' very unbecomin' so
fur, an' the people looks respectable enough,'
she says.</p>

<p>"'No jail birds in sight fur 's ye c'n see so
fur, be they?' I says. He, he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"You needn't make me out more of a
gump 'n I was," protested Mrs. Bixbee.
"An' you was jest as&mdash;&mdash;" David held up
his finger at her.</p>

<p>"Don't you sp'ile the story by discountin'
the sequil. Wa'al, putty soon the band struck
up some kind of a dancin' tune, an' the curt'in
went up, an' a girl come prancin' down to
the footlights an' begun singin' an' dancin',
an', scat my&mdash;&mdash;! to all human appearances
you c'd 'a' covered ev'ry dum thing she had

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>

on with a postage stamp." John stole a
glance at Mrs. Cullom. She was staring at
the speaker with wide-open eyes of horror
and amazement.</p>

<p>"I guess I wouldn't go very <i>fur</i> into pertic'lers,"
said Mrs. Bixbee in a warning tone.</p>

<p>David bent his head down over his plate
and shook from head to foot, and it was
nearly a minute before he was able to go on.
"Wa'al," he said, "I heard Polly give a kind
of a gasp an' a snort, 's if some one 'd throwed
water 'n her face. But she didn't say nothin',
an', I swan! I didn't dast to look at her fer a
spell; an' putty soon in come a hull crowd
more girls that had left their clo'es in their
trunks or somewhere, singin', an' dancin', an'
weavin' 'round on the stage, an' after a few
minutes I turned an' looked at Polly. He, he,
he, he!"</p>

<p>"David Harum," cried Mrs. Bixbee, "ef
you're goin' to discribe any more o' them
scand'lous goin's on I sh'll take my victuals
into the kitchen. <i>I</i> didn't see no more of
'em," she added to Mrs. Cullom and John,
"after that fust trollop appeared."</p>

<p>"I don't believe she did," said David, "fer
when I turned she set there with her eyes
shut tighter 'n a drum, an' her mouth shut

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>

too so's her nose an' chin most come
together, an' her face was red enough so 't a
streak o' red paint 'd 'a' made a white mark
on it. 'Polly,' I says, 'I'm afraid you ain't
gettin' the wuth o' your money.'</p>

<p>"'David Harum,' she says, with her
mouth shut all but a little place in the corner
toward me, 'if you don't take me out
o' this place, I'll go without ye,' she says.</p>

<p>"'Don't you think you c'd stan' it a little
longer?' I says. 'Mebbe they've sent home
fer their clo'es,' I says. He, he, he, he! But
with that she jes' give a hump to start, an' I
see she meant bus'nis. When Polly Bixbee,"
said David impressively, "puts that foot
o' her'n <i>down</i> somethin's got to sqush, an'
don't you fergit it." Mrs. Bixbee made
no acknowledgment of this tribute to
her strength of character. John looked at
David.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with a solemn bend of
the head, as if in answer to a question, "I
squshed. I says to her, 'All right. Don't
make no disturbance more'n you c'n help, an'
jes' put your hank'chif up to your nose 's if
you had the nosebleed,' an' we squeezed out
of the seats, an' sneaked up the aisle, an' by
the time we got out into the entry I guess my

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>

face was as red as Polly's. It couldn't 'a' ben
no redder," he added.</p>

<p>"You got a putty fair color as a gen'ral
thing," remarked Mrs. Bixbee dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; yes, ma'am, I expect that's
so," he assented, "but I got an extra coat o'
tan follerin' you out o' that theater. When
we got out into the entry one o' them fellers
that stands 'round steps up to me an' says,
'Ain't your ma feelin' well?' he says. 'Her
feelin's has ben a trifle rumpled up,' I says,
'an' that gen'ally brings on the nosebleed,'
an' then," said David, looking over Mrs. Bixbee's
head, "the feller went an' leaned up
agin the wall."</p>

<p>"David Harum!" exclaimed Mrs. Bixbee,
"that's a downright <i>lie</i>. You never spoke to
a soul, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;ev'rybody knows 't I ain't
more 'n four years older 'n you be."</p>

<p>"Wa'al, you see, Polly," her brother replied
in a smooth tone of measureless aggravation,
"the feller wa'n't acquainted with us,
an' he only went by appearances."</p>

<p>Aunt Polly appealed to John: "Ain't he
enough to&mdash;to&mdash;I d' know what?"</p>

<p>"I really don't see how you live with
him," said John, laughing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cullom's face wore a faint smile, as

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>

if she were conscious that something amusing
was going on, but was not quite sure what.
The widow took things seriously for the most
part, poor soul.</p>

<p>"I reckon you haven't followed theater-goin'
much after that," she said to her
hostess.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," Mrs. Bixbee replied with
emphasis, "you better believe I hain't. I
hain't never thought of it sence without tinglin'
all over. I believe," she asserted, "that
David 'd 'a' stayed the thing out if it hadn't
ben fer me; but as true 's you live, Cynthy
Cullom, I was so 'shamed at the little 't I did
see that when I come to go to bed I took my
clo'es off in the dark."</p>

<p>David threw back his head and roared
with laughter. Mrs. Bixbee looked at him
with unmixed scorn. "If I couldn't help
makin' a&mdash;&mdash;" she began, "I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! Polly," David broke in, "be
sure 'n wrap up when you go out. If you
sh'd ketch cold an' your sense o' the ridic'lous
sh'd strike in you'd be a dead-'n'-goner sure."
This was treated with the silent contempt
which it deserved, and David fell upon his
dinner with the remark that "he guessed
he'd better make up fer lost time," though as

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>

a matter of fact while he had done most of
the talking he had by no means suspended
another function of his mouth while so
engaged.</p>

<p class='center'><img src="images/099.jpg" width="362" height="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>For a time nothing more was said which
did not relate to the replenishment of plates,
glasses, and cups. Finally David cleaned up
his plate with his knife blade and a piece of
bread, and pushed it away with a sigh of fullness,
mentally echoed by John.</p>

<p>"I feel 's if a child could play with
me," he remarked. "What's comin' now,
Polly?"</p>

<p>"The's a mince pie, an' Injun puddin'
with maple sugar an' cream, an' ice cream,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" he exclaimed. "I guess
I'll have to go an' jump up an' down on the
verandy. How do you feel, John? I s'pose
you got so used to them things at the Eagle 't
you won't have no stomech fer 'em, eh?
Wa'al, fetch 'em along. May 's well die fer
the ole sheep 's the lamb; but, Polly Bixbee,
if you've got designs on my life, I may 's well
tell ye right now 't I've left all my prop'ty
to the Institution fer Disappinted Hoss
Swappers."</p>

<p>"That's putty near next o' kin, ain't it?"

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>

was the unexpected rejoinder of the injured
Polly.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, scat my&mdash;&mdash;!" exclaimed David,
hugely amused, "if Polly Bixbee hain't made
a joke! You'll git yourself into the almanic,
Polly, fust thing you know." Sairy brought
in the pie and then the pudding.</p>

<p>"John," said David, "if you've got a
pencil an' a piece o' paper handy I'd like to
have ye take down a few of my last words
'fore we proceed to the pie an' puddin' bus'nis.
Any more 'hossredish' in that bottle?"
holding out his glass. "Hi, hi! that's enough.
You take the rest on't," which John did,
nothing loath.</p>

<p>David ate his pie in silence, but before he
made up his mind to attack the pudding,
which was his favorite confection, he gave an
audible chuckle, which elicited Mrs. Bixbee's
notice.</p>

<p>"What you gigglin' 'bout now?" she
asked.</p>

<p>David laughed. "I was thinkin' of somethin'
I heard up to Purse's last night," he
said as he covered his pudding with the thick
cream sauce. "Amri Shapless has ben gittin'
married."</p>

<p>"Wa'al, I declare!" she exclaimed.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>

"That ole shack! Who in creation could
he git to take him?"</p>

<p>"Lize Annis is the lucky woman," replied
David with a grin.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, if that don't beat all!" said Mrs.
Bixbee, throwing up her hands, and even
from Mrs. Cullom was drawn a "Well, I
never!"</p>

<p>"Fact," said David, "they was married
yestidy forenoon. Squire Parker done the
job. Dominie White wouldn't have nothin'
to do with it!"</p>

<p>"Squire Parker 'd ortter be 'shamed of
himself," said Mrs. Bixbee indignantly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that trew love had
ought to be allowed to take its course?"
asked David with an air of sentiment.</p>

<p>"I think the squire 'd ortter be 'shamed
of himself," she reiterated. "S'pose them
two old skinamulinks was to go an' have
children?"</p>

<p>"Polly, you make me blush," protested
her brother. "Hain't you got no respect fer
the holy institution of matrimuny?&mdash;and&mdash;at
cet'ry?" he added, wiping his whole face
with his napkin.</p>

<p>"Much as you hev, I reckon," she retorted.
"Of all the amazin' things in this

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>

world, the amazinist to me is the kind of
people that gits married to each other in gen'ral;
but this here performence beats ev'rything
holler."</p>

<p>"Amri give a very good reason for't," said
David with an air of conviction, and then he
broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Ef you got anythin' to tell, tell it," said
Mrs. Bixbee impatiently.</p>

<p>"Wa'al," said David, taking the last of
his pudding into his mouth, "if you insist
on't, painful as 't is. I heard Dick Larrabee
tellin' 'bout it. Amri told Dick day before
yestiday that he was thinkin' of gettin' married,
an' ast him to go along with him to Parson
White's an' be a witniss, an' I reckon a
kind of moral support. When it comes to
moral supportin'," remarked David in passing,
"Dick's as good 's a professional, an' he'd go
an' see his gran'mother hung sooner 'n miss
anythin', an' never let his cigar go out durin'
the performence. Dick said he congratilated
Am on his choice, an' said he reckoned they'd
be putty ekally yoked together, if nothin' else."</p>

<p>Here David leaned over toward Aunt Polly
and said, protestingly, "Don't gi' me but jest
a teasp'nful o' that ice cream. I'm so full now
't I can't hardly reach the table." He took a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>

taste of the cream and resumed: "I can't give
it jest as Dick did," he went on, "but this is
about the gist on't. Him, an' Lize, an' Am
went to Parson White's about half after seven
o'clock an' was showed into the parler, an' in
a minute he come in, an' after sayin' 'Good
evenin'' all 'round, he says, 'Well, what c'n
I do fer ye?' lookin' at Am an' Lize, an' then
at Dick.</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' says Am, 'me an' Mis' Annis
here has ben thinkin' fer some time as how
we'd ought to git married.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Ought</i> to git married?' says Parson
White, scowlin' fust at one an' then at t'other.</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' says Am, givin' a kind o' shuffle
with his feet, 'I didn't mean <i>ortter</i> exac'ly,
but jest as <i>well</i>&mdash;kinder comp'ny,' he says.
'We hain't neither on us got nobody, an' we
thought we might 's well.'</p>

<p>"'What have you got to git married on?'
says the dominie after a minute. 'Anythin'?'
he says.</p>

<p>"'Wa'al,' says Am, droppin' his head
sideways an' borin' into his ear 'ith his middle
finger, 'I got the promise mebbe of a job
o' work fer a couple o' days next week.'
'H'm'm'm,' says the dominie, lookin' at him.
'Have <i>you</i> got anythin' to git married on?'

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>

the dominie says, turnin' to Lize. 'I've got
ninety cents comin' to me fer some work I
done last week,' she says, wiltin' down on to
the sofy an' beginnin' to snivvle. Dick says
that at that the dominie turned round an'
walked to the other end of the room, an'
he c'd see he was dyin' to laugh, but he come
back with a straight face.</p>

<p>"'How old air you, Shapless?' he says
to Am. 'I'll be fifty-eight or mebbe fifty-nine
come next spring,' says Am.</p>

<p>"'How old air <i>you</i>?' the dominie says,
turnin' to Lize. She wriggled a minute an'
says, 'Wa'al, I reckon I'm all o' thirty,' she
says."</p>

<p>"All o' thirty!" exclaimed Aunt Polly.
"The woman 's most 's old 's I be."</p>

<p>David laughed and went on with, "Wa'al,
Dick said at that the dominie give a kind of a
choke, an' Dick he bust right out, an' Lize
looked at him as if she c'd eat him. Dick
said the dominie didn't say anythin' fer a
minute or two, an' then he says to Am, 'I
suppose you c'n find somebody that'll marry
you, but I cert'inly won't, an' what possesses
you to commit such a piece o' folly,' he says,
'passes my understandin'. What earthly reason
have you fer wantin' to marry? On your

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>

own showin',' he says, 'neither one on you 's
got a cent o' money or any settled way o' gettin'
any.'</p>

<p class='center'><img src="images/106.jpg" width="365" height="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>"'That's jes' the very reason,' says Am,
'that's jes' the <i>very reason</i>. I hain't got
nothin', an' Mis' Annis hain't got nothin', an'
we figured that we'd jes' better git married an'

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>

settle down, an' make a good home fer us
both,' an' if that ain't good reasonin'," David
concluded, "I don't know what is."</p>

<p>"An' be they actially married?" asked
Mrs. Bixbee, still incredulous of anything so
preposterous.</p>

<p>"So Dick says," was the reply. "He says
Am an' Lize come away f'm the dominie's
putty down in the mouth, but 'fore long Amri
braced up an' allowed that if he had half a
dollar he'd try the squire in the mornin', an'
Dick let him have it. I says to Dick, 'You're
out fifty cents on that deal,' an' he says, slappin'
his leg, 'I don't give a dum,' he says; 'I
wouldn't 'a' missed it fer double the money.'"</p>

<p>Here David folded his napkin and put it in
the ring, and John finished the cup of clear
coffee which Aunt Polly, rather under protest,
had given him. Coffee without cream and
sugar was incomprehensible to Mrs. Bixbee.<br /><br /><br /></p>
